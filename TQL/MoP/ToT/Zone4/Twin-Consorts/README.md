# Twin Consorts - Heroic Mode Raid Guide

## 🎯 Quick Overview
**Enrage:** 10 minutes hard enrage  
**Tanks:** 2 | **Healers:** 2-3 (10M) / 5-7 (25M)  
**Structure:** 4 Phases - Darkness (3m) → Daylight (3m) → Break of Dusk → Final Phase  
**Bosses:** Lu'lin (Moon) 🌙 & Suen (Sun) ☀️ - Separate health pools

---

## 💀 DEADLY MECHANISMS

### ⚠️ **High Danger**
- **Moon Lotus Clouds** - Touch = 5s sleep (incapacitated)
- **Tidal Force** - Fast water waves, very difficult to dodge
- **Nuclear Inferno (Heroic)** - 8s channel, extreme raid-wide Fire damage
- **Blazing Radiance** - Stacking buff increases Suen's Fire damage (removable)
- **Flames of Passion** - Charge leaves deadly fire trail

### 🟡 **Medium Danger**
- **Cosmic Barrage** - Stars charge random ranged players, 8y AoE + knockback
- **Tears of the Sun** - Raid-wide Fire damage every second (channeled)
- **Light of Day** - Random player nuke, 8y radius
- **Ice Comet** - Ground AoE, creates Ice Comet add
- **Corrupted Healing** - Stacking DoT on healers who heal Beast tank
- **Lurkers in the Night (Heroic)** - Invisible adds deal random damage

---

## 🎮 HEROIC DIFFERENCES

### **New Abilities**

**Lu'lin (Darkness Phase):**
- **Lurkers in the Night** - Spawns invisible adds
  - Deal random raid damage
  - Only visible when Suen moves over them during Tears of the Sun
  - All become visible at end of Darkness Phase
  - Low threat, easy to tank once visible

**Suen (Daylight & Break of Dusk):**
- **Nuclear Inferno** - Every 60 seconds
  - 8s channel
  - Extreme raid-wide Fire damage per second
  - Boss immune to damage during channel (+100% spell deflection/dodge)
  - Icy Shadows buff reduces damage by 60%

### **Strategy Impact**
- Lurkers: Mostly ignore, kill at phase transition or during Nuclear Inferno
- Nuclear Inferno: Stack near Ice Comets for damage reduction
- Much tighter DPS requirements (must damage Suen in Darkness Phase)

---

- Nuclear Inferno = EXTREME (stack near comet)
- Plan cooldown rotation for Inferno casts

**Phase 3: Break of Dusk**
- HIGHEST healing phase
- Tidal Force = raid-wide burst

## 💡 HEROIC CELESTIAL STRATEGY

### **First Set (Before Break of Dusk)**

**Darkness Phase:**
- **Xuen (Tiger's Celerity)** → Use during a Cosmic Barrage
- **Niuzao (Fortitude)** → Use at end of phase (2:45 mark)
  - Helps survive final Cosmic Barrage + Lurker spawn

**Daylight Phase:**
- **Chi-Ji (Rush of Cranes)** → Use at 3:30-4:00
  - Cranes damage over time, need runway
- **Yu'lon (Serpent's Vitality)** → Use during Nuclear Inferno
  - Restores mana/health

### **Second Set (Break of Dusk)**

**Order of Usage:**
1. **Chi-Ji** immediately (4:00 damage window)
2. **Niuzao** for first Tidal Force
3. **Yu'lon** for healing/mana recovery
4. **Xuen** timed for second Tidal Force (slows waves)

**Cooldown Timing:**
- Chi-Ji: Pull of Break of Dusk
- Niuzao: ~30s in (first Tidal Force)
- Yu'lon: After first Nuclear Inferno
- Xuen: ~90s in (second Tidal Force)

---

## ⚔️ ABILITY HANDLING GUIDE

### **Moon Lotus** (P1)
- Spawned randomly far from center
- Sends slow-moving clouds all directions
- Touch = 5s sleep
- **Action:** Path around them, they're predictable

### **Cosmic Barrage** (P1)
- Stars spawn on ground
- Charge random ranged players after delay
- 8y AoE + knockback
- **Action:** Spread 8+ yards, ranged only targeted

### **Beast of Nightmares** (P1)
- Fixates one tank
- Only that tank can damage
- Healers get Corrupted Healing when healing that tank
- **Action:** Tank uses self-healing, minimal heals

### **Tears of the Sun** (P1, Suen appears)
- Channels raid-wide Fire damage
- **Action:** Apply DoTs to Suen, burst DPS

### **Light of Day** (All phases)
- Random player nuke, 8y AoE
- **Action:** Spread 8+ yards

### **Lurkers in the Night** (P1, Heroic)
- Invisible adds
- Deal random raid damage
- **Action:** Ignore until visible, kill at phase end

### **Fan of Flames** (P2)
- Stacking tank debuff, +25% Fire damage
- **Action:** Tank swap at 2-3 stacks

### **Flames of Passion** (P2)
- Charges random player
- Leaves fire trail
- 8y AoE + knockback
- **Action:** Spread, tanks adapt Suen position

### **Blazing Radiance** (P2-P3)
- Stacks throughout phase
- Increases Suen's Fire damage
- **Action:** Keep Suen near Ice Comets to remove

### **Ice Comet** (P2-P3)
- Ground projectiles → Ice Comet NPC
- Provides Icy Shadows buff (60% Fire reduction)
- Melts when Suen near (removes her Blazing Radiance)
- **Action:** Dodge projectiles, use comet for buffs

### **Nuclear Inferno** (P2-P3, Heroic)
- Every 60s, 8s channel
- Extreme raid-wide Fire damage
- Boss immune during cast
- **Action:** Stack near comet, all cooldowns

### **Tidal Force** (P3)
- Channels water waves
- Many directions, fast-moving
- Very high damage
- Boss immune during cast
- **Action:** Dodge reactively, use Tiger's Celerity

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### General
✅ Assign 4 players to Celestial duty (practice star patterns)  
✅ Both bosses must die, no shared health  
✅ Kill order: Suen first → easier final phase  
✅ Spread is default, stack only for Nuclear Inferno

### Phase 1
✅ Practice Suen burst windows (Tears of the Sun)  
✅ Healers minimize Beast tank healing  
✅ Don't kill Lurkers until phase end  
✅ Moon Lotus clouds are slow and predictable

### Phase 2
✅ Mark Ice Comet spawn locations  
✅ Tanks quickly reposition Suen to comets  
✅ Use Heroism here for max Suen damage  
✅ Nuclear Inferno every 60s, set timers

### Phase 3
✅ Tidal Force is hardest mechanic to dodge  
✅ Lu'lin immune during Tidal (don't waste DPS)  
✅ Suen immune during Inferno (good Lu'lin time)  
✅ Stack for Inferno, spread for everything else

### Common Mistakes
❌ Killing Ice Comets (need them for Blazing Radiance)  
❌ Not spreading enough (Light of Day chains)  
❌ Wasting DPS on immune bosses  
❌ Not stacking for Nuclear Inferno (60% reduction critical)  
❌ Killing Lu'lin first (harder final phase)  
❌ Not using Celestials optimally  
❌ Overhealing Beast tank (Corrupted Healing stacks)

---

## ✅ SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS

### Phase Completion Targets
- **Phase 1 (3:00):** Suen at <90% HP
- **Phase 2 (6:00):** Suen at <50% HP
- **Phase 3:** Suen dead by 8:00
- **Phase 4:** Final boss dead by 9:30

### Critical Metrics
- Zero deaths to Moon Lotus clouds
- Minimal Corrupted Healing stacks (<5 per healer)
- Blazing Radiance kept below 10 stacks (P2)
- All Tidal Force waves survived (P3)
- Clean Celestial activations (8/8 uses)

### Heroism Usage
- **Correct:** Daylight Phase with Chi-Ji active
- Timed for sustained Suen burn
- Not during Nuclear Inferno

---
