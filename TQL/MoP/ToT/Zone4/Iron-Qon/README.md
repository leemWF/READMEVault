# Iron Qon - Heroic Mode Raid Guide

## 🎯 Quick Overview
**Enrage:** 12 minutes hard enrage  
**Tanks:** 2 | **Healers:** 2-3 (10M) / 5-7 (25M)  
**Structure:** 4 Sequential Phases - Kill 3 Quilens → Fight all enemies at once

---

## 💀 DEADLY MECHANISMS

### ⚠️ **Instant Death Mechanics**
- **Lightning Lines (Phase 2)** - Standing in = massive damage + 3 stacks = 20s stun
- **Frozen Cyclone (Phase 4)** - Touch = stunned + lose 5% max HP every 2s
- **Rushing Winds Tornadoes** - Caught = picked up, stunned, damaged

### 🔴 **High Danger**
- **Molten Overload** - Boss reaches 100 energy = +50% damage + raid spam (unhealable)
- **Fist Smash (Phase 4)** - Raid-wide Physical damage over 7.5s (heavy)
- **Rising Anger (Phase 4)** - Stacking +10% damage every 10s (soft enrage)
- **Burning Cinders (Fire Lines)** - Stacking Fire DoT
- **Frozen Blood (Ice Lines)** - Frost damage + 25% slow stacks
- **Freeze** - Raid-wide Frost burst when debuff expires

### 🟡 **Medium Danger**
- **Impale** - Stacking bleed on tank (requires swap)
- **Arcing Lightning** - Player stunned 30s, must be rescued
- **Dead Zone** - 10s channel blocks damage from 2 sides
- **Frozen Resilience** - 10% damage reflected to attackers
- **Whirling Winds (Heroic)** - Fast-moving tornado crosses room
- **Frost Spike (Heroic)** - Targeted ground AoE + knockup
- **Unleashed Flame (Heroic)** - Raid AoE on largest stack

---

## 🎮 HEROIC DIFFERENCES

### **Phase 1-3: Aerial Quilens**
While fighting one Quilen, another flies overhead casting abilities:

**Phase 1 (Fighting Ro'shak):**
- ✈️ **Quet'zal flying** - Casts Whirling Winds (tornado every ~25s) + Arcing Lightning

**Phase 2 (Fighting Quet'zal):**
- ✈️ **Dam'ren flying** - Casts Frost Spike (ground AoE every ~12s)

**Phase 3 (Fighting Dam'ren):**
- ✈️ **Ro'shak flying** - Casts Unleashed Flame (largest stack or random, every ~15s)

### **Phase 4: All Quilens Return**
- Quilens leave at **25% HP** (not death)
- Phase 4: Fight Iron Qon + all 3 Quilens simultaneously
- Each Quilen uses one signature ability
- Must kill Quilens before focusing Iron Qon
- **Kill Order:** Dam'ren → Ro'shak → Quet'zal → Iron Qon

## 📋 RAID ASSIGNMENTS

### **Tank Assignments**

**Throughout Fight:**
- Swap on **Impale stacks** (2-3 stacks recommended)
- Tank #1: Primary boss tank
- Tank #2: Off-tank, ready to taunt

**Phase 4 Specific:**
- Tank #1: Iron Qon
- Tank #2: All 3 Quilens
- Position Quilens away from raid
- Rotate cooldowns heavily during Rising Anger stacks

---

### **DPS Assignments**

#### **Phase 1 - Ro'shak Kill Target**
**Stack Rotation Groups:**
- Divide raid into 3 groups (10M) or 5 groups (25M)
- Each group needs 3+ players (10M) or 5+ players (25M)

**Group Rotation:**
```
Group 1: Stack   → Spread → Spread → Stack (cycle)
Group 2: Spread → Stack   → Spread → Spread
Group 3: Spread → Spread → Stack   → Spread
```

**Timing:**
- Stack until 3 Unleashed Flame casts
- Spread to drop Scorched stacks (30s)
- Next group stacks before Molten Overload

**Responsibilities:**
- Call group assignments over voice
- Watch for Whirling Winds (dodge tornado)
- Rescue Arcing Lightning targets immediately
- Never stand in fire lines

#### **Phase 2 - Quet'zal Kill Target**

**Positioning:**
- Spread loosely around room
- Avoid all lightning lines (3 stacks = 20s stun)
- Back of room is safe zone

**Windstorm Protocol:**
1. Pull starts → everyone to center
2. Watch individual tornado patterns (small circles)
3. Navigate OUT of windstorm circle
4. Move to back of room (opposite pull location)
5. Continue DPS from safe zone

**Responsibilities:**
- Rescue Arcing Lightning targets (click cloud)
- Dodge Frost Spikes from aerial Dam'ren
- Exit Windstorm quickly (no DPS inside = -80% damage)

#### **Phase 3 - Dam'ren Kill Target**

**Positioning:**
- Use same stack rotation as Phase 1
- Position for Dead Zone (attack from unshielded sides)
- Avoid ice lines (slows stacking)

**Responsibilities:**
- Rotate groups for Unleashed Flame (from aerial Ro'shak)
- Move to unshielded side during Dead Zone
- Continue avoiding persistent tornadoes/lines

#### **Phase 4 - Kill Priority**

**Kill Order:**
1. **Dam'ren** (25% → 0%) - Dead Zone most disruptive
2. **Ro'shak** (25% → 0%) - Unleashed Flame dangerous
3. **Quet'zal** (25% → 0%) - Arcing Lightning manageable
4. **Iron Qon** (100% → 0%) - All cooldowns

**Burn Strategy:**
- Stack in tornado-free zone
- Use Heroism on Dam'ren pull (at 25% HP in P3)
- All personal DPS cooldowns
- Ranged spread until all Quilens dead
- Stack after Quilens die (heal through Fist Smash)

---

### **Healer Assignments**

**Phase-Specific Priorities:**

**Phase 1:**
- Moderate raid damage (Unleashed Flame split)
- Scorched stacks increase damage taken
- Emergency: If Molten Overload happens, spam heals + CDs

**Phase 2:**
- Light raid damage normally
- Frost Spike targets need spot heals
- Inside Windstorm = useless (-80% healing)

**Phase 3:**
- Heavy sustained raid damage
- Freeze bursts (moderate raid-wide)
- Frozen Resilience reflection damage (10%)
- Unleashed Flame from aerial Ro'shak

**Phase 4:**
- EXTREME raid damage
- Fist Smash every 7.5s
- Ignited Cyclone constant Fire DoT
- Rising Anger increases everything
- All healing cooldowns on rotation

**Cooldown Rotation (Phase 4):**
```
0:00  → Healer 1: Major CD
0:30  → Healer 2: Major CD
1:00  → Healer 3: Major CD
1:30  → Healer 1: Major CD again (if available)
Repeat until boss dead
```

**Dispel Priority:**
- None required (Arcing Lightning not dispellable)
- Focus on tank externals during high Impale stacks

## ⚔️ PRO TIPS

### Phase 1
✅ Pre-assign groups with raid marks (use class/role mix)  
✅ Tanks can be in stacking groups (no cleave)  
✅ Call rotations 5s before needed  
✅ Keep Molten Energy below 80 if possible  
✅ Mark aerial tornado direction

### Phase 2
✅ Study tornado patterns for 5s before moving  
✅ Each tornado spins in small circle (predictable)  
✅ Don't greed DPS during Windstorm (-80% is worthless)  
✅ Assign "rescuers" for Arcing Lightning (melee priority)  
✅ Back of room = safest Windstorm exit

### Phase 3
✅ Stack rotation less critical than Phase 1  
✅ DPS positioning > soaking damage  
✅ Dead Zone: Mark which side to move to  
✅ High passive healing phase

### Phase 4
✅ Use Heroism when Dam'ren reaches 25% (end of P3)  
✅ Ranged stay spread until all 3 Quilens dead  
✅ Dam'ren must die first (Dead Zone ruins DPS)  
✅ Stack after Quilens dead (maximize healing)  
✅ Healer cooldowns on strict rotation  
✅ Frozen tornadoes = instant death

### Common Mistakes
❌ Not stacking enough players (need 3/5 minimum)  
❌ Letting Molten Overload happen  
❌ Staying inside Windstorm circle  
❌ Not rescuing Arcing Lightning fast enough  
❌ Attacking Dead Zone shielded sides  
❌ Wrong Phase 4 kill order  
❌ Spreading too much in Phase 4 (after Quilens die)  
❌ Touching frozen tornadoes

---

## ✅ SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS

### Phase Completion Times (Target)
- **Phase 1:** 3:00 (before 4 Molten Overloads)
- **Phase 2:** 2:30 (minimize tornado buildup)
- **Phase 3:** 2:30 (enter P4 with time)
- **Phase 4:** 4:00 (before Rising Anger overwhelms)

### Critical Metrics
- Zero Molten Overloads in Phase 1
- All Arcing Lightning rescued <5s
- Zero players trapped in tornadoes during Windstorm
- Clean Dead Zone transitions (no DPS loss)
- Phase 4: Dam'ren dead within 60s of Heroism

### Heroism Timing
- **Correct:** When Dam'ren reaches 25% HP (end of Phase 3)
- Use to burst Dam'ren 25% → 0% quickly
- Maintains for Ro'shak burn
