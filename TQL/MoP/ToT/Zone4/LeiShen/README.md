## ⚡ Fight Overview

Complex 3-phase encounter with 2 transition phases. Fight revolves around **4 conduits** in room corners that grant Lei Shen abilities. Boss must stay near conduits or he'll spam raid-wide damage. Duration: ~8.5 minutes with 10-minute enrage.

**Raid Size:** 2 tanks, 2-3 healers (10m) / 5-7 healers (25m)

---

## 🔴 DEADLY MECHANISMS

### Phase-Wide Threats
- **Discharged Energy** ⚡ - Spammed when boss NOT near conduit. Stacking raid damage that will wipe you. **ALWAYS keep boss near a conduit**
- **Compromised Quarters** 💀 - After each transition, highest-energy conduit's quarter deals constant damage. Stay out

### Phase One (100-65%)
- **Decapitate** 🪓 - Tank gets hit for lethal damage. **Distance = survival** (20-30y needed). Leaves 30s debuff (100% Physical dmg). **Tank swap required**
- **Thunderstruck** ⚡ - Lightning strikes random location. **Move 20+ yards away immediately** or die
- **Crashing Thunder** - Damaging void zones. Don't stand in them

### Phase Two (65-30%)
- **Fusion Slash** ⚔️ - Heavy Nature damage + knockback to tank. Stacking debuff (100% increased Fusion Slash damage, 1min). **Tank swap required**
- **Lightning Whip** ⚡💀 - Area damage that's **instantly lethal**. Shows animation before hitting. **Must avoid**. Leaves lightning lines (jump over them)
- **Ball Lightning** ⚡ - Spawns adds at random players. Spread to minimize initial damage, then kill adds

### Phase Three (30-0%)
- **Overwhelming Power** 🛡️ - Stacking tank debuff. **Swap at 10 stacks**
- **Violent Gale Winds** 🌪️ - Pushes raid across platform + increasing stacking damage. **Don't get pushed off edge**
- Retains: Thunderstruck, Ball Lightning, Lightning Whip

## 🎯 CONDUITS & ASSIGNMENTS

### The 4 Conduits

Each conduit grants Lei Shen an ability when he's within 30y. Conduits gain 2 Energy/sec near boss, level up at 100 Energy (resets to 0), making abilities stronger.

#### **North - Static Shock** 💥
- Debuff on random player → 8 sec later splits damage among players within 8y
- **Assignment:** Stack 1-2 helpers (10m) or 4-5 players (25m) on debuffed player

#### **East - Diffusion Chain** ⚡
- Chain lightning that jumps within 10y, damage increases per jump
- Spawns **Diffused Lightning** adds (chain lightning spam)
- **Assignment:** Spread 10+ yards. Kill adds immediately as priority

#### **South - Overcharge** ⚡
- Roots random player 6 sec → electricity ring expands (damage + 3s stun to anyone hit)
- Safe zone directly around rooted player
- **Assignment:** Stack on rooted player before ring expands

#### **West - Bouncing Bolt** ⚡
- Lightning bolts at random ground locations. Damage split among players in 6y
- If no players hit → spawns **Unharnessed Power** add + bolt bounces again
- **Assignment:** Soak all bolts (1 player each). Kill any adds that spawn

## 📋 PHASE ONE STRATEGY (100-65%)

### Positioning & Movement
1. Keep boss near conduits in rotation - move every 10-20 sec
2. **Never let conduit reach 100 Energy** before transition
3. **Target conduit to overload:** East (Diffusion Chain) - leave it at 86-90 Energy
   - This conduit gets destroyed after Transition 1

### Conduit Rotation
- Start **East** (target) → keep until 86-90 Energy
- Move **clockwise/counter-clockwise** to adjacent conduit → 60-70 Energy
- Continue rotation through all 4 conduits
- Minimizes time away from conduits = less Discharged Energy

### Tank Assignments
- **Decapitate timing:** Off-tank taunts → main tank runs 20-30y away FAST
- Use mobility cooldowns (Heroic Leap, Roll, etc.)
- Debuff prevents tanking for 30s (handled by rotation)

### Raid Positioning
- Stay mobile for Thunderstruck
- Avoid Crashing Thunder void zones
- Handle conduit mechanics as described above

---

## ⚡ FIRST TRANSITION (45 seconds)

**All 4 conduit abilities active simultaneously**

### Group Assignments
Split raid into **4 groups** covering 4 quarters:
- **10-man:** 2 groups of 2, 2 groups of 3
- **25-man:** 3 groups of 6, 1 group of 7

**Critical:** Groups must soak all Bouncing Bolts in their quarter (prevent add spawns)

### Execution
- Each group handles all 4 conduit mechanics in their area
- Stack for Static Shock, spread for Diffusion Chain
- Move to Overcharged players, soak Bouncing Bolts
- Healers position on borders between quarters (10m)

---

## 📋 PHASE TWO STRATEGY (65-30%)

**3 conduits remain (East destroyed). Its quarter is compromised (stay out).**

### Conduit Selection
- **Target to overload:** Adjacent conduit to destroyed one (North or South)
- Goal: Have half the platform available for Phase 3

### Key Mechanics
- **Fusion Slash:** Tank swap on cast (knockback + stacking debuff)
- **Ball Lightning:** Spread out → DPS adds down
- **Lightning Whip:** Dodge the telegraph → jump over lightning lines
- **Continue conduit mechanics** with remaining 3 conduits

### Tank Positioning
- Careful of knockback near platform edges
- Can be instantly fatal

---

## ⚡ SECOND TRANSITION (45 seconds)

**3 conduit abilities active (East inactive + compromised)**

Similar to Transition 1 but with only 3 quarters available:
- Adjust group positioning for available space
- Bouncing Bolt shouldn't target inactive quarter (kill adds if it does)
- Same mechanics handling as Transition 1

---

## 📋 PHASE THREE STRATEGY (30-0%)

**All conduits disabled. Two quarters compromised.**

### Priority Mechanics
1. **Tank swap at 10 stacks** of Overwhelming Power
2. **Violent Gale Winds:** Don't get pushed off platform
3. **Thunderstruck:** Move to opposite side of platform from tank/melee
   - After cast → run back to boss
4. **Ball Lightning:** Kill adds
5. **Lightning Whip:** Dodge + jump lightning lines

### Positioning
- Boss near platform edge
- Ranged/healers at opposite edge (safe from Thunderstruck targeting)
- Move as needed for mechanics

### Notes
- Use Stampeding Roar if Thunderstruck + Violent Gale Winds overlap
- Increasing damage from Violent Gale Winds over time
- **Heroism/Bloodlust recommended here** (burn before Violent Gale Winds overwhelms healers)

## 🔥 HEROIC DIFFERENCES

### Major Changes
1. **Diffused Lightning adds** fixate on spawn target (can't tank away)
2. **Discharged Energy** debuff persists longer → stacks will accumulate
3. **Overloaded conduits stay active** - Lei Shen permanently gains that ability
4. **Helm of Command** (Transitions) - Pushes random players toward edges (1 in 10m, 3 in 25m)
5. **Ball Lightning** now hits 3y area (not single target)

### Heroic Phase One
- **Overload West first** (Bouncing Bolt) - best choice for permanent ability
- Minimize Discharged Energy casts - move boss between conduits quickly
- Brewmaster tanks ideal (Provoke increases boss speed)

### Heroic Transitions
- **Helm of Command:** Targeted players stand center → run toward Lei Shen with speed boosts
- Use Leap of Faith on players near edges
- **Static Shock:** Use immunities to survive damage
- Still soak all Bouncing Bolts despite Helm of Command interference

### Heroic Phase Two
- **10-man:** Ranged spread, kill Ball Lightning adds
- **25-man:** 8 ranged in arc around boss (20y max, 3y apart) → Death Knight grips all adds with Gorefiend's Grasp → AoE down
- **Overload North** (Static Shock) for 25-man, flexible for 10-man

### Heroic Phase Three
- **Thunderstruck positioning:** Boss at platform edge, targetable players at opposite edge
- Move back after Thunderstruck cast
- Use Stampeding Roar for Thunderstruck + Violent Gale Winds overlap
- Heroism/Bloodlust critical in this phase
