# Megaera - Raid Leader Strategy Guide

## 📋 **Fight Overview**
Megaera is a **hydra encounter** where you fight multiple heads in sequence. You never attack Megaera's body - only her heads. Kill 7 heads total to defeat the encounter. Two heads are always active near the platform (attackable), and when you kill one, two heads of that same type spawn at the back of the cave (casting ranged abilities). The fight escalates in difficulty as more heads spawn at the back.

**Core Mechanic:** Kill heads near platform (14% boss HP each) → They respawn at back of cave → Back heads cast abilities → Repeat until 7 heads dead

---

## 🐲 **THE THREE HEAD TYPES**

### **🔥 Flaming Head (Fire Damage)**
**Near Platform:** Ignite Flesh (frontal cone, stacking Fire DoT)
**Back of Cave:** Cinders (DoT on random players, leaves fire void zones)

### **❄️ Frozen Head (Frost Damage)**
**Near Platform:** Arctic Freeze (frontal cone, freeze at 5 stacks)
**Back of Cave:** Torrent of Ice (beam chases players, leaves ice void zones)

### **☣️ Venomous Head (Nature Damage)**
**Near Platform:** Rot Armor (frontal cone, +10% damage taken per stack)
**Back of Cave:** Acid Rain (impact damage based on distance)

### **🔮 Arcane Head (Heroic Only)**
**Near Platform:** Diffusion (frontal cone, redirects 10% healing per stack)
**Back of Cave:** Nether Tear (spawns Nether Wyrm adds with interrupts/stuns)

## ⚠️ **DEADLY MECHANISMS**

### **Platform Mechanics (Attackable Heads)**

| Mechanic | Danger Level | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Rampage** | 🔴🔴 HIGH | 20 seconds after killing head - Both heads cast raid-wide magic damage (increases 25% per head type at back) |
| **Hydra Frenzy** | 🔴 HIGH | When head killed, remaining head gains +20% attack speed stack (removable only by killing it) |
| **Elemental Blood** | 🟡 ESCALATING | Killed heads gain +10% permanent magic damage when they respawn (NOT removable, stacks all fight) |
| **Megaera's Rage** | 🔴🔴🔴 LETHAL | If no one in melee range = spam cast at raid = wipe |
| **Breath Attacks** | 🔴 HIGH | Frontal cones with stacking debuffs requiring tank swaps |

### **Back of Cave Mechanics (Inactive Heads)**

| Head Type | Ability | Danger Level | Details |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Flaming** | Cinders | 🔴 HIGH | DoT on random players<br>Normal: Leaves void zone when dispelled<br>Heroic: Leaves void zone every 3 seconds |
| **Frozen** | Torrent of Ice | 🔴🔴 HIGH | Beam chases players 8 seconds, leaves ice void zones<br>Heroic: Void zones expand over 2 minutes |
| **Venomous** | Acid Rain | 🔴🔴 HIGH | Impact damage, reduced by distance (15-20y safe)<br>Heroic: Three balls instead of one |
| **Arcane (H)** | Nether Tear | 🟡 MEDIUM | Spawns Nether Wyrms with interruptible Nether Spike + Suppression (stun) |

### **Critical Interactions**

✅ **Cinders + Icy Ground:** Players with Cinders DoT can run over ice void zones to despawn them
✅ **Torrent of Ice + Fire Void Zones:** Beam can pass over fire void zones to despawn them

---

## 🔴 **HEROIC MODE CHANGES**

### **⚡ Modified Mechanics**

**Cinders (Heroic):**
- Leaves fire void zone **every 3 seconds** (not just on dispel)
- Must dispel in safe location quickly

**Icy Ground (Heroic):**
- Void zones **expand to 2x size over 2 minutes**
- Room becomes increasingly covered in ice

**Acid Rain (Heroic):**
- Targets **three random players** (instead of one)
- Much harder to avoid all three impacts

### **🔮 Arcane Head (NEW IN HEROIC)**

**Near Platform:**
- Diffusion breath: Stacking debuff that redirects 10% of healing received to allies within 8 yards

**Back of Cave:**
- Spawns Nether Wyrm adds
- Wyrms cast:
  - **Nether Spike:** Interruptible nuke on random players
  - **Suppression:** Interruptible 15-second stun (dispellable)

**Strategy:** DPS heads over Wyrms, interrupt/dispel Wyrms, kill Wyrms during Rampage downtime

---

## 💡 **CRITICAL TIPS**

### **General Strategy**

✅ **Kill Order Balance:** Never let one head type gain 3+ Hydra Frenzy stacks - rotate kills between types
✅ **7 Heads to Win:** Each head = ~14% boss HP, need to kill 7 total
✅ **Rampage Windows:** Stack during 20-second Rampage after each head death, use healing cooldowns
✅ **Tank Proximity:** ALWAYS keep someone in melee range or Megaera's Rage wipes raid
✅ **Escalating Difficulty:** More heads at back = more abilities + more Rampage damage + higher Elemental Blood stacks

### **Cinders Management**

✅ **Normal Mode:**
- Run over ice void zones to clear them
- Move to safe location (away from raid)
- Get dispelled, leaving one fire void zone
- Fire void zones = permanent obstacles

✅ **Heroic Mode:**
- Void zone drops every 3 seconds while DoT active
- Must dispel ASAP in safe location
- Cannot afford multiple void zones in bad spots
- Use for clearing ice void zones if needed

### **Torrent of Ice Management**

✅ **Kiting:**
- Targeted player runs away immediately (high impact damage)
- Never kite over raid location
- Leaves ice void zone trail behind

✅ **Void Zone Clearing:**
- Kite beam over fire void zones to despawn them
- Heroic: Ice expands over time - prioritize clearing bad ice

### **Acid Rain Management**

✅ Move 15-20 yards from impact location
✅ Clear visual warning before impact
✅ Some classes can ignore with magic reduction cooldowns
✅ **Heroic:** Three simultaneous impacts - spread more, move faster

### **Heroic: Nether Wyrm Management**

✅ **DPS Priority:** Heads > Wyrms (always)
✅ **Kill Windows:** Switch to Wyrms during Rampage (no heads attackable)
✅ **Interrupt Priority:** Nether Spike > Suppression
✅ **Dispel:** Remove Suppression stun immediately
✅ **Tank:** Off-tank or DPS with aggro pickup

## 📊 **READY-TO-USE ASSIGNMENTS**

### **Tank Assignments**

| Phase | Tank 1 | Tank 2 |

## ⚙️ **PHASE BREAKDOWN**

### **Phase 1: First Head (0-14% Boss Damage)**
- 2 heads active: Frozen + Flaming (recommended start)
- Kill Frozen Head

- Second Rampage: Higher damage (1 head type buffing)
- Handle Torrent of Ice

### **Phase 3: Third Head (28-42% Boss Damage)**

---

## 🎯 **COOLDOWN SCHEDULE**

**Bloodlust/Heroism:**
- Use during **6th or 7th Rampage** (highest damage, final push)

**DPS Cooldowns:**
- Use on cooldown (heads die relatively fast)
- Save for Bloodlust window if close to end

**Defensive Cooldowns:**
- Rotate for each Rampage
- Save strongest for final 2-3 Rampages

**Tank Cooldowns:**
- Rotate for high breath stacks (3-4 stacks)
- Use for Rampage if taking both head types

---

## 🚨 **COMMON MISTAKES**

❌ **Letting one head type stack 3+ Hydra Frenzy** - Tank gets overwhelmed
❌ **No one in melee range** - Megaera's Rage wipes raid
❌ **Poor Cinders dispel locations** - Fire void zones block movement
❌ **Kiting Torrent over raid** - Heavy damage to multiple players
❌ **Not moving from Acid Rain** - Massive damage
❌ **Killing Venomous Head in Heroic** - Three Acid Rains = chaos
❌ **DPSing Wyrms over Heads (Heroic)** - Extends fight, more void zones
❌ **Standing spread during Rampage** - Healing inefficient
❌ **Tanks not swapping on breaths** - Debuffs stack too high
❌ **Not using Cinders to clear ice** - Room becomes unplayable

---

## 📝 **PULL SEQUENCE**

### **Normal Mode:**

1. **Pull** - Start with 2 heads active (Frozen + Flaming recommended)
2. **Kill First Head** - Focus Frozen Head
3. **Rampage 1** - Stack, heal through 20 seconds
4. **Active Heads** - Tanks split, face away, begin swapping
5. **Kill Second Head** - Focus Flaming Head
6. **Rampage 2** - Stack, handle Torrent of Ice if targeted
7. **Ongoing** - Kill heads in rotation, never let one gain 3+ Hydra Frenzy
8. **Void Zone Management:**
   - Cinders: Clear ice, dispel in safe spots
   - Torrent: Kite away, clear fire void zones
   - Acid Rain: Move 15-20 yards
9. **Final Push** - Bloodlust during 6th/7th Rampage, burn last head

### **Heroic Mode:**

1. **Pull** - Same as Normal
2. **Never Kill Venomous** - Three Acid Rains too difficult
3. **Kill Order** - Rotate: Frozen → Flaming → Arcane (repeat)
4. **Cinders Management** - Dispel immediately, void zone every 3 seconds
5. **Ice Expansion** - Monitor expanding ice void zones, use Cinders to clear if needed
6. **Nether Wyrms** - Kill during Rampage, interrupt Nether Spike/Suppression
7. **Three Acid Rains** - If Venomous alive, spread more for three impacts
8. **DPS Priority** - Heads > Wyrms always
9. **Final Push** - Same as Normal, Bloodlust late
