# Ji-Kun - Raid Leader Strategy Guide

## 📋 **Fight Overview**
Ji-Kun is a **vertical encounter** with nest management. Ji-Kun stays on a central platform while raid members handle adds on nests located above and below. Nests activate every 30 seconds throughout the fight. Players fly between nests using feathers dropped by killed adds. The fight is a recurring DPS check - kill adds before they evolve into unkillable Juveniles.

**Core Mechanic:** Nests activate every 30s → Kill adds before they evolve → Use feathers to fly between nests → Prevent Juveniles from spawning

---

## 🪺 **THE NEST SYSTEM**

### **Lower Nests (5 total, below platform)**
- Contain Young Eggs that hatch into Hatchlings (4 in 10m, 5 in 25m)
- Hatchlings call for food via Ji-Kun's Feed Young
- After eating for 10 seconds, Hatchlings become **Fledgelings** (much stronger)
- Fledgelings eventually lay Mature Eggs → spawn **Juveniles**
- **Must kill Hatchlings before they finish eating**

### **Upper Nests (3 total, above platform)**
- Contain Mature Eggs of Ji-Kun
- Eggs hatch over 20 seconds into **Juveniles**
- **Must kill eggs before they hatch**

### **Juveniles** 🔴🔴🔴 **DEADLY**
- Cannot be reached from platform by ranged DPS
- Fly above raid dropping slime balls that create void zones
- **Will overwhelm raid if they spawn - MUST PREVENT**

### **Nest Activation Pattern**
- **Every 30 seconds**, a new nest activates (red beam indicates which)
- Nests activate in clockwise pattern (starting northeast lower nest)
- Sometimes lower + upper nests activate simultaneously

## ⚠️ **DEADLY MECHANISMS**

### **Ji-Kun's Platform Abilities**

| Ability | Danger Level | Details |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Infected Talons** | 🟡 HIGH | Stacking Nature DoT on tank |
| **Talon Rake** | 🔴 HIGH | High damage + debuff increases damage from next Talon Rake (1 min) |
| **Quills** | 🔴🔴 HIGH | 8-second channel, raid-wide damage (hits platform + lower nests) |
| **Caw** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Sound waves at 2 (10m) / 5 (25m) random players, 8-yard splash |
| **Down Draft** | 🔴🔴 LETHAL | 8-second channel pushes all players away from Ji-Kun - Run toward boss or get pushed off |
| **Feed Young** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Slime balls that create Feed Pool void zones |

### **Feed Pool Void Zones**

**Properties:**
- Spawn where Feed Young lands (if not intercepted in air)
- Deal Nature damage over time
- Apply Slimed debuff (stacking, permanent, increases damage from future Slimed)
- **Can be despawned** by standing in them for 3 seconds

**Interception (DPS Boost):**
- Players with Flight buff can fly up and catch slime mid-air
- Prevents void zone from spawning
- Grants Primal Nutriment: +30% damage/healing first stack, +10% each additional stack (30 seconds)

### **Add Evolution Chain** 🔴🔴🔴

```
Hatchlings (weak)
    ↓ Feed Young lands
    ↓ Eats for 10 seconds
Fledgelings (strong)
    ↓ Lays eggs over time
    ↓ Eggs mature
Juveniles (UNKILLABLE from platform)
    ↓ Drops slime bombs
RAID WIPE
```

## 🔴 **HEROIC MODE CHANGES**

### **⚡ Nest Guardians (NEW)**

**Spawn Locations (10-man):**
- Activation 2 (lower nest)
- Activation 4 (upper nest)
- Activation 8 (lower nest)
- Activation 10 (upper nest)
- Activation 12 (upper nest)

**Spawn Locations (25-man):**
- Activations: 2, 6, 12, 17, 22, 29

**Mechanics:**
- Must be tanked immediately
- Face away from raid (standard tank positioning)
- If not engaged: Deals high raid damage + interrupts casting = wipe
- Must be killed in addition to nest adds

### **Other Heroic Changes**

**Daedalian Wings:**
- Reduced from 4 charges → **3 charges**

**Quills:**
- Significantly increased damage
- Requires healing cooldowns

---

## 💡 **CRITICAL MECHANICS**

### **Daedalian Wings (Flight System)**

**How to Get:**
- Kill Hatchlings → Drop feathers
- Walk over feather → Gain Daedalian Wings buff (3-4 charges)
- Applies Lesson of Icarus debuff (1 minute) - Cannot pick up new feathers while active

**How to Use:**
- Extra action button: Flight (10-second duration, 15-second cooldown)
- Use to travel between nests
- Use to fly up to upper nests
- Use to intercept Feed Young for Primal Nutriment buff
- **No fall damage when buff expires**

**Travel Methods:**
- Platform → Lower nests: Jump/run off platform
- Lower nests → Platform: Use Flight
- Lower nest → Lower nest: Use Flight
- Platform/Lower → Upper nests: Use Flight

### **Tank Swap Requirements**

**Debuffs:**
- **Infected Talons:** Stacking Nature DoT
- **Talon Rake:** High damage + increases damage from next Talon Rake by X% (1 minute)

**Swap Timing:**
- Swap every 2-3 Talon Rakes
- Off-tank must be ready to handle Nest Guardians (Heroic)

## 📊 **READY-TO-USE ASSIGNMENTS**

### **Tank Assignments**

| Tank | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Tank 1** | Ji-Kun Primary | • Tank Ji-Kun on platform<br>• Swap with Tank 2 every 2-3 Talon Rakes<br>• **Heroic:** Travel to Nest Guardian spawns when needed |
| **Tank 2** | Ji-Kun Secondary | • Tank Ji-Kun on platform (during swaps)<br>• **Heroic:** Primary Nest Guardian tank<br>• Coordinate with nest teams for Guardian timing |

**Heroic Tank Coordination:**
- Tanks alternate: One stays on Ji-Kun, one goes to Guardian nest
- Must pre-position before Guardian spawn
- Use Flight charges to travel to Guardian nests

### **Nest Team Assignments**

**Team Composition:**
- **10-man:** 1 healer + 3 DPS per team
- **25-man:** 1 healer + 4 DPS per team
- Create 2 teams that alternate nests

**Team Rotation:**
- **Team 1:** Nest activations 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...
- **Team 2:** Nest activations 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...
- When two nests activate simultaneously: Each team takes one

**Nest Team Objectives:**

**Lower Nests:**
1. Jump down to nest when it activates
2. Kill all Hatchlings BEFORE Feed Young lands
3. Collect feathers (Daedalian Wings)
4. Fly back to platform
5. **Heroic:** Kill Nest Guardian if present

**Upper Nests:**
1. Fly up to nest using Flight charges
2. Kill all Mature Eggs before they hatch (20 seconds)
3. Return to platform
4. **Heroic:** Kill Nest Guardian if present

### **Platform Team Assignments**

**Platform DPS (Remaining players not on nest teams):**
- DPS Ji-Kun
- Spread 8+ yards apart (Caw damage)
- Despawn Feed Pools (stand in for 3 seconds)
- Run toward Ji-Kun during Down Draft
- Intercept Feed Young mid-air for Primal Nutriment (if have Flight charges)

**Platform Healers:**
- Heal tanks (Talon Rake damage)
- Prepare for Quills (heavy raid damage)
- Heal nest teams during Quills (damage hits lower nests too)
- **Heroic:** Use healing cooldowns for Quills

### **Special Role: Food Interceptors**

**Assigned Players (25-man recommended, optional 10-man):**
- 4 strong DPS with good movement
- After killing lower nest adds, return to platform with 3 Flight charges
- When Ji-Kun casts Feed Young on platform, fly up and intercept slime balls
- Goal: Stack Primal Nutriment (+30% damage first stack, +10% additional)
- Maximizes raid DPS significantly

**How to Intercept:**
- Must be flying (use Flight ability)
- Position where slime balls fall
- Catch mid-air before hitting ground
- Each catch prevents void zone + grants buff stack

## ⚙️ **NEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGY**

### **Nest Priority**

**Critical Timing:**
- Hatchlings spawn → ~10 seconds before Feed Young lands
- Must kill all Hatchlings in this window
- If they eat: Become Fledgelings (much tankier, high damage)
- If Fledgelings survive: Lay eggs → Juveniles spawn → Wipe

**Upper Nest Timing:**
- Eggs hatch in 20 seconds
- Must kill all eggs before timer expires
- If eggs hatch: Juveniles spawn → Wipe

### **Simultaneous Nest Strategy**

**When Lower + Upper Activate Together:**
- Team 1 → Lower nest
- Team 2 → Upper nest
- Split based on team strengths (upper nests need more burst, lower need sustained)

### **Feed Pool Management**

**Platform players rotate despawning void zones:**
1. Identify closest Feed Pool
2. Check HP is sufficient (DoT damage)
3. Stand in pool for 3 seconds
4. Pool despawns
5. Take Slimed stack (permanent)

**Priority:** Despawn pools in high-traffic areas (near tanks, center platform)

## 🎯 **PHASE TIMELINE**

| Time | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0:00 | Pull | Tanks engage Ji-Kun, Team 1 ready |
| 0:00 | First nest activates (NE lower) | Team 1 jumps down, kills Hatchlings |
| 0:30 | Second nest activates | Team 2 jumps down, kills Hatchlings |
| 1:00 | Third nest activates | Team 1 (now back) handles |
| 1:30 | Fourth nest activates (often upper) | Team 2 flies up, kills eggs |
| 2:00 | Fifth + Sixth (simultaneous) | Teams split, one lower one upper |
| Ongoing | Every 30 seconds | Alternate teams, coordinate simultaneous |
| Throughout | Feed Young casts | Interceptors catch slime OR platform despawns pools |
| Throughout | Quills (~60s intervals) | All healers use cooldowns |
| Throughout | Down Draft (~120s intervals) | Everyone runs toward Ji-Kun |

## 🚨 **DEADLY SITUATIONS**

| Situation | Danger | Response |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Hatchlings finish eating** | 🔴🔴🔴 | Become Fledgelings - much harder to kill, will lay eggs |
| **Mature Eggs hatch** | 🔴🔴🔴 | Spawn Juveniles = likely wipe |
| **Juveniles spawn** | 🔴🔴🔴 | Unkillable, spam void zones = wipe |
| **Down Draft with no movement** | 🔴🔴 | Pushed off platform = death |
| **Too many Feed Pools** | 🔴 | Platform unplayable, Slimed stacks too high |
| **Missing nest activation** | 🔴🔴 | Adds evolve, overwhelm nest team |
| **Nest Guardian unengaged (H)** | 🔴🔴🔴 | Raid damage + interrupt spam = wipe |
| **Platform healer on nest during Quills** | 🔴 | Platform team takes massive unhealed damage |

## 💪 **OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

**Flight Charge Management:**
- Save 1 charge for emergency return to platform
- Use 3rd charge for Food interception (DPS boost)
- Don't waste charges on unnecessary movement

**Food Interception Priority (25-man):**
- 4 designated DPS after first lower nest clear
- Return to platform with 3 charges
- Intercept all Feed Young casts
- Stack Primal Nutriment to 3-4 stacks
- Massive DPS increase

**Nest Optimization:**
- Pre-position before nest activates
- Jump down immediately when red beam appears
- Kill Hatchlings with AoE quickly
- Grab feathers efficiently (don't miss any)
- Return to platform ASAP

**Platform Optimization:**
- Spread out except during Down Draft
- Despawn 1 Feed Pool per player per fight minimum
- Keep center platform clear of pools
- Use movement abilities during Down Draft

**Heroic Tank Optimization:**
- Pre-plan Guardian nest assignments
- Position before Guardian spawn
- Quick engagement essential (prevents raid damage)
- Quick kill required (nest eggs/Hatchlings still active)

---

## 📝 **PULL SEQUENCE**

**Pre-Pull:**
- Assign Team 1 + Team 2 nest groups
- Designate Food Interceptors (25-man)
- Explain Flight system to all raiders
- Mark nest activation beam locations

**Normal Mode:**
1. Pull Ji-Kun, tanks engage
2. 0:00 - Team 1 jumps to first nest (NE lower)
3. Team 1 kills Hatchlings, grabs feathers, flies back
4. 0:30 - Team 2 jumps to second nest
5. Alternate teams every 30 seconds
6. When simultaneous nests: Split teams appropriately
7. Platform team: Spread, run toward boss on Down Draft, despawn pools
8. Food Interceptors: Catch Feed Young mid-air with Flight
9. Kill Ji-Kun while preventing Juvenile spawns

**Heroic Mode:**
1. Same as Normal, plus:
2. Tanks coordinate Guardian nest assignments
3. Tank travels to Guardian nest BEFORE spawn
4. Engage Guardian immediately on spawn
5. Nest team + tank kill Guardian + eggs/Hatchlings
6. Healing cooldowns for every Quills (much higher damage)
7. Only 3 Flight charges = more conservative usage

**Bloodlust:** Use late in fight (80-90% boss HP) when most stressful or when Juveniles may spawn
