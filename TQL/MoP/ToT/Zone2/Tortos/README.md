# Tortos - Raid Leader Strategy Guide

## 📋 **Fight Overview**
Tortos is a **stationary boss encounter** with a unique turtle-kicking mechanic. The fight revolves around killing Whirl Turtle adds, kicking them at the boss to interrupt his raid-wiping breath attack, and managing waves of Vampiric Cave Bats. The fight is mechanically simple but requires coordination and execution.

**Core Mechanic:** Kill Whirl Turtles → Kick them at boss to interrupt Furious Stone Breath → Repeat

**Soft Enrage:** ~8 minutes - massive wave of Whirl Turtles overwhelms raid

---

## 🐢 **THE UNIQUE MECHANIC: TURTLE KICKING**

### **How Turtle Kicking Works:**
1. Whirl Turtles spawn and move randomly around room
2. When near death, turtle casts **Shell Block** - becomes immune and stationary
3. All raid members get **Kick Shell** extra action button when near a Shell Blocked turtle
4. Face the direction you want to kick, then press extra action button
5. Turtle flies through air toward target
6. If turtle hits enemy: **Interrupts spell + 25% damage taken debuff for 20 seconds**

**This is essential for interrupting Tortos' Furious Stone Breath!**

## ⚠️ **DEADLY MECHANISMS**

### **Tortos Abilities**

| Ability | Danger Level | Details |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Furious Stone Breath** | 🔴🔴🔴 LETHAL | Massive raid-wide damage every 45 seconds (at 100 Fury) - MUST BE INTERRUPTED by kicking turtle |
| **Snapping Bite** | 🔴🔴 HIGH | ~60% tank HP damage every 8-10 seconds - Requires cooldowns/topped HP |
| **Quake Stomp** | 🔴 HIGH (Normal) / 🔴🔴🔴 LETHAL (Heroic) | 65% max HP damage (Normal) / 100% max HP damage (Heroic) - Stuns 1 second, increases Rockfall frequency for 8s |
| **Rockfall** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Falling stalactites - High damage in 5y, lower damage in 20y - Blue circles warn impact |
| **Growing Fury** | 🔴 HIGH | If no one in melee range, gains 10 Fury/second → Furious Stone Breath comes SOONER |

### **Add Mechanics**

**Whirl Turtles (3 every 60 seconds):**
- 🟡 **Spinning Shell** - Damages + knocks back players within 5 yards
- ✅ **Shell Block** - Turtle becomes immune at low HP, can be kicked

**Vampiric Cave Bats (Wave every 30 seconds):**
- 🔴 **Drain the Weak** - If target below 350k(550k heroic) HP, bats heal for 50x damage dealt
- Must be killed before they stack up

---

## 🔴 **HEROIC MODE CHANGES**

### **⚡ The Two Critical Changes**

**1. Quake Stomp = 100% Max HP Damage**
- Up from 65% in Normal mode
- **Will instantly kill anyone not properly shielded**
- This is the main challenge of Heroic mode

**2. Humming Crystals** (NEW MECHANIC)

**How Humming Crystals Work:**
- Several crystals scattered around room
- Attack crystal with direct damage spell → Gain shield absorbing 15% max HP
- **Heals increase shield size** (up to max 75% of max HP)
- Heals do NOT heal the player, only increase shield capacity
- No internal cooldown - can refresh constantly
- Entire raid can have shields simultaneously

**Critical Shield Mechanics:**
- ⚠️ **Once shielded, player becomes UNHEALABLE until shield breaks**
- Low-HP players should get healed BEFORE taking shield
- Shields break from: Quake Stomp damage, Rockfall damage, Snapping Bite (tanks)
- Crystals take damage but have massive HP (won't die accidentally)

---

## 💡 **CRITICAL TIPS**

### **General Tips**

✅ **Boss Position:** Tortos is STATIONARY - never moves
✅ **Tank in Melee Range:** CRITICAL - Tank must NEVER leave melee range or Growing Fury accelerates Furious Stone Breath
✅ **Turtle Timing:** 3 Whirl Turtles spawn every 60s, Furious Stone Breath every 45s = Always have turtles available
✅ **First Breath Critical:** First Whirl Turtles spawn shortly before first Furious Stone Breath - ALL DPS help kill first turtle fast
✅ **Shell Concussion Window:** After kicking turtle, Tortos takes 25% increased damage for 20 seconds - Use offensive cooldowns
✅ **Rockfall Positioning:** Blue circles = stalactite warning - Move immediately
✅ **Quake Stomp + Rockfall Combo:** Stomp increases Rockfall frequency for 8 seconds - Extra vigilant during this time
✅ **DPS Priority Discipline:** Ranged on Whirl Turtles, Melee on Tortos/Bats - Don't deviate

### **Tank Tips**

✅ **Tortos Tank (Tank 1):**
- NEVER leave melee range of Tortos
- Boss mods warn of Snapping Bite - Use active mitigation for each
- Be topped off before each Snapping Bite (~60% HP damage)
- Snapping Bite has visible cast time - predictable
- **Heroic:** Always maintain shield from Humming Crystal

✅ **Bat Tank (Tank 2):**
- Pick up bats as they spawn
- Move them next to Tortos for melee cleave
- **NEVER drop below 350k HP** - Allows bats to heal via Drain the Weak
- Bats are not hard hitting but will stack up if not killed
- **Heroic:** Always maintain shield from Humming Crystal

✅ **Tank Swaps:** None required - roles are fixed

### **Healer Tips**

✅ **Tank Healing Priority:**
- Tortos tank before each Snapping Bite
- Bat tank must stay above 350k HP always
- **Heroic:** Keep tank shields at max capacity (75% max HP)

✅ **Raid Healing Priority:**
- Heavy damage after Quake Stomp (65% max HP Normal / 100% Heroic)
- Moderate damage from Rockfall hits
- Random damage from Rockfall + Whirl Turtle contact

✅ **Heroic Shielding Strategy:**
- Heal shielded players BEFORE Quake Stomp to maximize shield size
- **Goal: Everyone at 75% shield capacity before each Stomp**
- Don't heal low-HP players who have shields (they're unhealable)
- Wait for shields to break before healing low-HP players

### **DPS Tips**

✅ **Ranged DPS Priority:**
1. Whirl Turtles (always)
2. Tortos (when no turtles alive)
3. Help on first turtle (everyone needs to help kill it fast)

✅ **Melee DPS Priority:**
1. Tortos (primary target with cleave on bats)
2. Vampiric Cave Bats (via cleave)
3. First Whirl Turtle (help ranged kill it fast)

✅ **Interrupt Assignments:** One ranged DPS + one backup assigned to kick turtles at Furious Stone Breath
✅ **Offensive Cooldowns:** Use during Shell Concussion debuff (25% increased damage taken)
✅ **Heroic Shielding:** Maintain shield at all times, refresh frequently

### **Turtle Kicking Tips**

✅ **Positioning for Kick:**
- Stand so turtle is between you and Tortos
- Face boss while standing behind turtle
- Use Kick Shell extra action button when Furious Stone Breath cast begins

✅ **Timing:**
- Move into position 5-10 seconds before Furious Stone Breath
- Wait for cast to begin, then kick immediately
- Backup kicker ready at different turtle

✅ **Common Mistakes:**
- Not facing the right direction
- Standing too far from turtle (extra action button won't appear)
- Getting knocked back by active Whirl Turtle
- Kicking too early or too late

✅ **Safety:**
- Assign backup kicker in case primary gets knocked or makes mistake
- Multiple turtles should be Shell Blocked before each breath for options

## ⚡ **HEROIC MODE STRATEGY BREAKDOWN**

### **The Shield Game**

**Phase 1: Shield Acquisition (Everyone, constantly)**
1. Attack Humming Crystal with direct damage spell
2. Receive 15% max HP shield
3. Get healed to 75% shield capacity
4. Refresh shield after it breaks

**Phase 2: Pre-Quake Stomp (Every ~30-40s)**
1. All players ensure shield active
2. Healers spam heals on shielded players
3. Goal: Everyone at 75% shield capacity
4. Quake Stomp hits for 100% max HP but shields absorb it

**Phase 3: Post-Quake Stomp**
1. Shields break from Stomp damage
2. Players now healable again
3. Top everyone off
4. Repeat from Phase 1

### **Shield Priority List**
1. **Tanks** - Always maintain 75% shields (they take constant damage)
2. **Low-HP players** - Heal first, THEN shield (or they stay low HP)
3. **Everyone else** - Maintain shields, refresh after Quake Stomp

### **Common Heroic Mistakes**
❌ Shielding low-HP players (they become unhealable at low HP)
❌ Not healing shielded players before Quake Stomp (shields too small)
❌ Forgetting to refresh shields after they break
❌ Tanks dropping shields (they die to Snapping Bite)

### **Alternative Strategy: Bat Kiting (If DPS Tight)**
- Some guilds kite Vampiric Cave Bats instead of killing
- Monk tank ideal for mobility
- Regular stuns on bats
- Not recommended if you have DPS for kill

---

## 🚨 **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**

❌ **Tortos tank leaving melee range** - Accelerates Furious Stone Breath
❌ **Not killing first Whirl Turtle fast** - No turtle to kick = raid wipe
❌ **Primary kicker knocked back** - Have backup ready
❌ **Kicking turtle too early** - Interrupt misses cast
❌ **Bat tank dropping below 350k HP** - Bats heal to full
❌ **Standing in Rockfall** - Avoidable damage kills
❌ **Not topped before Quake Stomp** - Especially deadly in Heroic
❌ **Melee on Whirl Turtles, Ranged on Tortos** - Wrong priority = chaos
❌ **Multiple turtle waves alive** - Lose control of room
❌ **Low-HP players taking shields (Heroic)** - Become unhealable at low HP
❌ **Not maximizing shields before Stomp (Heroic)** - 100% max HP damage = death
