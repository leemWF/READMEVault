## 💀 DEADLY MECHANISMS

### ⚠️ **Instant Wipe Mechanics**
- **Deadly Mutagen** - Viscous Horror reaches Primordius = instant wipe
- **Berserk** - 8 minute hard enrage, wipes raid in ~10 seconds
- **Volatile Pools** - Boss touching them = +1 Evolution stack + 10% heal

### 🔴 **High Danger**
- **Primordial Strike** - Frontal cone, heavy tank damage every ~20s
- **Black Blood** - Stacking tank DoT (Viscous Horror tank)
- **Malformed Blood** - Stacking tank DoT (Primordius tank)
- **Evolution** - Boss gains +10% damage per stack (permanent)
- **Pathogen Glands** - 10s heavy Nature DoT on random players

---

## 🎮 HEROIC DIFFERENCES

### New Mechanics
- **Viscous Horror** spawns every 30 seconds
  - Must be tanked away from boss (10+ yards)
  - Applies Black Blood stacking debuff
  - Explodes if it reaches Primordius
- **4 mutations active** instead of 3
- Higher health and damage across the board

## 📋 RAID ASSIGNMENTS

### **Tank Assignments**

**Tank 1 (Primordius Tank):**
- Face boss away from raid
- Taunt at 3-4 stacks of Malformed Blood
- Move boss away from Volatile Pools
- Kill Living Fluids when off-tanking

**Tank 2 (Viscous Horror Tank):**
- Tank Viscous Horrors 10+ yards from boss
- Taunt at 3-4 stacks of Black Blood
- Never let add reach Primordius
- Position adds for cleave when possible

**Tank Swap Rotation:**
- Swap every 3-4 stacks of respective debuffs
- Coordinate taunts over voice
- Off-tank helps with Living Fluid cleanup

### **DPS Assignments**

**Phase 1 - Not Fully Mutated (0-4 stacks):**
- **Priority:** Kill Living Fluids ONLY
- Collect Mutagenic Pools to gain mutation stacks
- Never kill fluids near boss (Volatile Pool risk)
- Highest DPS players collect stacks first

**Phase 2 - Fully Mutated (5 stacks, 2 min buff):**
- **Priority:** DPS Primordius exclusively
- **CRITICAL:** Avoid ALL Mutagenic Pools (harmful debuffs)
- Help on Viscous Horror if needed
- Use cooldowns during Heroism window

**Phase 3 - Reset Cycle:**
- Return to killing Living Fluids
- Collect 5 new mutation stacks
- Stagger transformations (melee first, then ranged)

**Final Phase (Last 90s):**
- All players DPS boss exclusively
- Ignore remaining adds
- Use all cooldowns

### **Healer Assignments**

**Spread healing across:**
- Tank damage from both bosses
- Raid-wide AoE mechanics
- Random target debuffs

**Cooldown rotation based on active mutations:**
- Ventral Sacs = Heavy raid AoE, plan cooldowns
- Caustic Gas = Stack damage, coordinate externals
- Pathogen Glands = Spot healing priority
- Metabolic Boost = All mechanics faster, conserve mana

---

## 🎲 BOSS MUTATIONS (RNG Pool)

Boss gains 1 random mutation per Evolution (max 4 active):

### 1. **Ventral Sacs** 🟢
- Constant raid-wide Nature damage
- **Action:** Sustained healing required

### 2. **Caustic Gas** 🔴
- Heavy Nature damage split among players within 25y
- **Action:** Stack near boss (minimum 8-10 players)

### 3. **Acidic Spines** 🟡
- Nukes random targets, damages 5y radius
- **Action:** Spread 5+ yards apart

### 4. **Pathogen Glands** 🟣
- 10s heavy Nature DoT on random players
- **Action:** Spot heal affected players immediately

### 5. **Metabolic Boost** ⚡

### 6. **Erupting Pustules** 🔶
- Random falling projectiles, Nature damage
- **Action:** Dodge ground indicators

---

## ⚔️ MUTATION COMBINATIONS TO WATCH

### **Nightmare Combos:**

**Caustic Gas + Acidic Spines:**
- Requires stacking AND spreading (impossible)
- **Solution:** Stack tight, use healing/defensive cooldowns, let adds through to force next Evolution

**Caustic Gas + Erupting Pustules:**
- Must stack while dodging projectiles
- **Solution:** Stack tight, designated raid position, dodge as group

**Metabolic Boost + Anything:**
- All abilities hit faster, higher pressure
- **Solution:** Healer cooldown rotation, defensive usage

## 📊 STRATEGY TIMELINE

**0:00-2:00** - Wave 1
- Collect first 5 mutation stacks on top DPS
- Kill all Living Fluids away from boss
- Establish tank swap rhythm

**2:00-4:00** - First Burn

- Non-mutated continue fluid cleanup
- Manage 2-3 Evolution stacks

**4:00-6:00** - Wave 2
- Reset mutations on first group
- Transform second wave of DPS
- Handle 4-6 Viscous Horrors

**6:00-7:30** - Second Burn
- Maximize Fully Mutated uptime
- **Heroism here** (most players transformed)
- Push boss below 20%

**7:30-8:00** - Execute
- Ignore adds, full boss DPS
- All remaining cooldowns
- Race against enrage

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Mutation Management
✅ Stagger transformations (melee → ranged → healers)  
✅ Never save Mutagenic Pools (they despawn)  
✅ High DPS transforms first for max uptime  
✅ **NEVER** touch pools when Fully Mutated  
✅ Don't dispel players (removes ALL buffs)

### Positioning
✅ Kill Living Fluids mid-room, never near boss  
✅ Tank Viscous Horrors at max melee range  
✅ Create clear path for Mutagenic Pool collection  
✅ Mark safe zones during Volatile Pool spawns

### Cooldown Usage
✅ Use Heroism when 80%+ raid is Fully Mutated  
✅ Healer CDs for Caustic Gas + other mutations  
✅ Tank CDs for high Evolution stacks (6+)  
✅ Save personal DPS CDs for Fully Mutated windows

### Common Mistakes
❌ Collecting pools while Fully Mutated  
❌ Killing fluids too close to boss  
❌ Letting Viscous Horror reach Primordius  
❌ Not staggering mutation transformations  
❌ Saving Heroism for execute phase
