# Dark Animus - Heroic Mode Raid Guide

## 🎯 Quick Overview
**Enrage:** 10 min (irrelevant) | **Soft Enrage:** Boss reaches 100 Anima = instant wipe  
**Tanks:** 2 | **Healers:** 2-3 (10M) / 5-7 (25M)  
**Key Mechanic:** Anima resource management - concentrate Anima into fewest golems possible

---

## 💀 DEADLY MECHANISMS

### ⚠️ **Instant Wipe Mechanics**
- **FULL POWER (100 Anima)** - Dark Animus reaches max Anima = instant wipe
- Wipes raid in seconds with extreme damage bursts

### 🔴 **High Danger**
- **Acceleration Link** - Golems touching = +250% damage, +250% attack speed, +30% movement
- **Crimson Wake** - Void zone follows player, extremely high damage
- **Explosive Slam** - Stacking debuff increases future slam damage
- **Interrupting Jolt** - Raid damage + 8.5s silence if caught casting
- **Empower Golem** (Heroic) - Stacking +24% damage buff on lowest health golem

### 🟡 **Medium Danger**
- **Matter Swap** - Position swap + huge damage split (tank's max HP)
- **Touch of the Animus** - Stacking Fire DoT (permanent)
- **Anima Font** - Affected players radiate AoE damage
- **Anima Ring** - Tank must exit, gains DoT + increased melee damage taken

---

## 🎮 HEROIC DIFFERENCES

### **Critical Changes**
1. **152 Total Anima** (instead of 100)
   - Boss starts with **52 Anima** (ACTIVE FROM PULL)
   - All Anima Golems still have 4 Anima each (25 × 4 = 100 Anima)

2. **Siphon Anima Delay**
   - Boss doesn't cast Siphon Anima until **2:00 into fight**
   - Gives time to position Anima before drain begins

3. **Empower Golem** (New)
   - Periodically heals lowest health golem by 3%
   - Grants stacking +24% damage buff (permanent)
   - Makes Massive Golems incredibly dangerous late fight

4. **Anima Ring Enhanced**
   - Now also applies Fire DoT
   - Still increases melee damage taken

5. **Inactive Golems Killable** (10M only)
   - Can be killed for strategic purposes

## 📊 ANIMA SYSTEM EXPLAINED

### **Anima Pools**
```
Entity              | Anima Pool | Starting Anima | Activation
--------------------|------------|----------------|------------------
Anima Golem (×25)   | 4          | 4 (full)       | Active from start
Large Golem (×8)    | 8          | 0              | Activates at 8 Anima
Massive Golem (×2)  | 36         | 0              | Activates at ANY Anima
Dark Animus         | 100        | 52 (Heroic)    | ACTIVE FROM PULL
```

### **Anima Flow Rules**
✅ When golem dies → Anima jumps to **nearest golem with space**  
✅ 10M: 3 Large + 13 Anima Golems disabled (still drain when boss active)  
✅ 25M: All golems functional  
✅ Total Anima: **152** (never changes)

### **Boss Abilities by Anima Level**
```
52  Anima → Touch of Animus (permanent DoT)
52  Anima → BOSS ACTIVE (Heroic start)
10  Anima → Anima Ring (tank mechanic)
25  Anima → Anima Font (AoE corruption)
75  Anima → Interrupting Jolt (raid damage + silence)
100 Anima → FULL POWER (WIPE)
```

## 📋 HEROIC STRATEGY - 10 MAN

### **Phase 1: Anima Setup (0:00-1:30)**

```
ROOM LAYOUT:

    [Large] [Large] [Large]  ← 3 Inactive Large Golems
       ↑       ↑       ↑
    (Anima) (Anima) (Anima)  ← Kill 6 Anima Golems here

           [DARK ANIMUS]     ← Boss (52 Anima, ACTIVE)
              (Center)

    [Massive] ←── Kill 18 Anima Golems
    (36 Anima)

    [Massive] ←── Kill 18 Anima Golems  
    (36 Anima)

    1 Anima Golem → Kill near boss (4 Anima to boss)
```

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **First 90 seconds:**
   - Kill 6 Anima Golems near 3 inactive Large Golems (2 each)
   - Kill 18 Anima Golems to fill BOTH Massive Golems to 36 Anima
   - DPS boss during this time (use Heroism if desired)

2. **At 1:30 mark:**
   - 1 Anima Golem remaining
   - Kill it near Dark Animus (boss now at 56 Anima)

3. **At 2:00 mark:**
   - Boss begins Siphon Anima
   - Drains from: 2 Massive Golems + 3 Inactive Large Golems
   - You have limited time to kill boss

### **Phase 2: Boss Burn (1:30-End)**

**Anima Drain Timeline:**
```
2:00 → Siphon #1  → 56 + 5  = 61 Anima
2:06 → Siphon #2  → 61 + 5  = 66 Anima
2:12 → Siphon #3  → 66 + 5  = 71 Anima
2:18 → Siphon #4  → 71 + 5  = 76 Anima (INTERRUPTING JOLT UNLOCKS)
2:24 → Siphon #5  → 76 + 5  = 81 Anima
...continues every 6 seconds until 100 Anima = WIPE
```

**Kill boss before he reaches 100 Anima (tight timer)**

## 📋 HEROIC STRATEGY - 25 MAN

### **Phase 1: Anima Setup (0:00-1:30)**

```
ROOM LAYOUT:

    [Large] [Large] [Large] [Large] [Large] [Large] [Large] [Large]
    ↑ DO NOT ACTIVATE THESE - Keep away from dead golems ↑

           [DARK ANIMUS] (52 Anima, ACTIVE)
              (Center)

    [Massive]         [Massive]
    (36 Anima)       (36 Anima)
       ↑                 ↑
    Kill 18 Anima    Kill 18 Anima
    Golems here      Golems here

    6-7 Anima Golems remain alive (2 Anima each)
```

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **First 90 seconds:**
   - Kill 18 Anima Golems → Massive Golem #1 (36 Anima)
   - Kill 18 Anima Golems → Massive Golem #2 (36 Anima)
   - Leave 7 Anima Golems alive
   - Can kill 1 near boss for simplicity (boss → 56 Anima)
   - DPS boss hard (use Heroism here)

2. **At 2:00 mark - First Siphon:**
   ```
   Boss drains: 6 Anima Golems + 2 Massive Golems
   52 + 8 = 64 Anima
   ```

3. **At 2:06 - Second Siphon:**
   ```
   Boss drains: 6 Anima Golems (2→1 each) + 2 Massive (35→34)
   64 + 8 = 72 Anima
   ```

4. **At 2:12 - Setup for Third Siphon:**
   - **BEFORE this cast:** Kill 2 Anima Golems → Massive Golems (refill to 36)
   - **BEFORE this cast:** Kill 2 Anima Golems → 2 other Anima Golems (consolidate)
   - Now only **4 entities** have Anima: 2 Massive + 2 Anima Golems

5. **At 2:12 - Third Siphon:**
   ```
   Boss drains: 2 Anima Golems + 2 Massive Golems
   72 + 4 = 76 Anima (INTERRUPTING JOLT UNLOCKS)
   ```

6. **At 2:18 - Fourth Siphon:**
   ```
   Boss drains: 2 Anima Golems (1→0 each DIE) + 2 Massive (36→35)
   76 + 4 = 80 Anima
   ```

7. **Final Phase:**
   - Only 2 Massive Golems remain with Anima
   - Boss drains 2 per tick (every 6 seconds)
   - Kill boss before he drains remaining 20 Anima

### **Anima Drain Timeline (25M):**
```
2:00 → 64 Anima (8 sources)
2:06 → 72 Anima (8 sources)
2:12 → 76 Anima (4 sources) ← JOLT UNLOCKS
2:18 → 80 Anima (2 sources) ← Anima Golems die
2:24 → 82 Anima (2 sources)
2:30 → 84 Anima
2:36 → 86 Anima
...continues until 100 = WIPE at ~4:00
```

## 🎯 RAID ASSIGNMENTS

### **Tank Assignments**

**Tank 1 (Dark Animus):**
- Face boss away from raid
- Watch for Anima Ring - exit immediately
- Taunt when other tank gets Anima Ring debuff
- Move out of Explosive Slam indicators
- Prepare for Matter Swap position swaps

**Tank 2 (Massive Golems):**
- Pick up Massive Golems as they activate
- Tank in CENTER of room (prevents Anima Golem chaos during Matter Swap)
- Face away from raid
- Watch for Explosive Slam - dodge ground indicators
- Coordinate dispel timing for Matter Swap
- Late fight: Rotate with DPS to handle Empower Golem stacks

**Off-Tank Responsibilities:**
- When not tanking boss, help with Anima Golem collection
- When boss tank gets Anima Ring debuff, taunt immediately
- Can pick up Massive Golem temporarily during Matter Swap chaos

### **DPS Assignments**

**Phase 1 - Anima Golem Execution:**

**Designated Golem Killers (2-3 DPS):**
- Assigned to kill Anima Golems in specific locations
- **CRITICAL:** Must position correctly before killing
- Use marks/waypoints for Massive Golem positions
- Stop all AoE/DoTs when golem is near death

**Boss DPS (Remaining DPS):**
- Focus Dark Animus from pull
- Use cooldowns early (Heroism at pull in 25M)
- Switch to help finish Anima Golems if falling behind schedule
- **After 2:00:** Exclusive boss DPS

**Anima Golem Tanking:**
- Plate DPS and tanky specs help tank Anima Golems
- **NEVER** let golems get within melee range of each other
- Keep 10+ yard spacing at all times
- Stop damaging golem once assigned killer takes over

### **Healer Assignments**

**Healer Priority:**
1. Tanks (especially during Empower Golem stacks)
2. Matter Swap targets (huge burst healing needed)
3. Touch of Animus DoT targets
4. Anima Font affected players (if they fail positioning)
5. Interrupting Jolt raid damage

**Cooldown Rotation (Post-2:00):**
- Every 30s: Rotate healing cooldowns
- At 76 Anima: Major cooldown for first Interrupting Jolt
- Save externals for Matter Swap on low health tanks
- Conserve mana - fight is long

**Dispel Assignment:**
- Assign 1-2 healers to watch Matter Swap
- Dispel after **4-5 seconds** (optimal damage split)
- Too early = tank takes full damage
- Too late = swapped player takes massive damage
- Both targets must be topped before dispel

---

## 🎲 GOLEM ABILITIES

### **Anima Golem** (25 total, 12 active in 10M)
- **Acceleration Link** - If touching another golem: +250% damage, +250% attack speed, +30% move speed
- **Solution:** Keep 10+ yards apart at ALL TIMES

### **Large Anima Golem** (8 total, 5 inactive in 10M)
- **Crimson Wake** - 30s void zone that follows random player, extremely high damage
- **Solution:** Skip activation entirely (heroic strat ignores these)

### **Massive Anima Golem** (2 total, both active)

**Matter Swap:**
- Swaps tank with farthest player
- Damage = tank's max HP, split between both targets
- Damage increases the longer debuff stays on
- **Optimal:** Dispel after 4-5 seconds

**Explosive Slam:**
- Ground indicator → 12y AoE
- Applies stacking debuff: +increased damage from future slams
- **Solution:** Dodge ground effect, reset stacks

- Random player gets permanent Fire DoT
- Stacks throughout fight
- Healing intensive later
- **Affected players:** Note your debuff count for healers

### **Anima Ring** (10+ Anima)
- Ring of spheres closes on tank
- Tank MUST exit (consumes 1 sphere)
- Applies: Fire DoT + 50% increased melee damage (15s)
- **Action:** Exit ring, taunt swap immediately

### **Anima Font** (25+ Anima)
- Touch of Animus targets now radiate AoE damage
- Affected players deal damage to nearby allies
- **Action:** Spread 8+ yards from all players

### **Interrupting Jolt** (75+ Anima)
- Raid-wide Nature damage
- 8.5s silence if caught casting
- **Action:** Stop ALL casts when boss begins casting

### **Matter Swap** (Massive Golems)
- Debuff on tank, lasts 12s
- Swaps position with farthest player
- Damage = tank's max HP, split between both
- **Action:** Dispel after 4-5s, top both targets first

### **Explosive Slam** (Massive Golems)
- Obvious ground indicator
- 12y AoE + stacking debuff
- **Action:** Move out of red circle

### **Empower Golem** (Heroic)
- Boss heals lowest HP golem by 3%
- Grants permanent +24% damage (stacks)
- Late fight: Massive Golems hit VERY hard
- **Action:** Tank swaps, externals, major cooldowns

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Anima Management
✅ Use raid markers on Massive Golem positions  
✅ Assign specific DPS to kill specific Anima Golems  
✅ Call out positioning before every kill  
✅ Use "/stop attack" macro to avoid accidental kills  
✅ In 25M: Mark the 6 golems to keep alive with raid icons

### Positioning
✅ Anima Golems must stay 10+ yards apart (Acceleration Link check)  
✅ Tank Massive Golems in CENTER (Matter Swap safety)  
✅ Ranged/healers loosely spread for Anima Font  
✅ Create "kill zones" with markers for proper Anima transfer

### Cooldown Usage
✅ 10M: Save Heroism for boss burn (post-2:00)  
✅ 25M: Use Heroism on pull for golem cleanup  
✅ Personal DPS CDs on cooldown after 2:00  
✅ Tank CDs for Empower Golem stacks (late fight)

### Common Mistakes
❌ Letting Anima Golems touch (instant wipe potential)  
❌ Killing golems in wrong locations (activates Large Golems)  
❌ Dispelling Matter Swap too early/late  
❌ Casting during Interrupting Jolt  
❌ Touch of Animus players not spreading for Font  
❌ Continuing golem kills after 2:00 mark

---

## ✅ SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS

### 10-Man
- Massive Golems at 36 Anima each before 1:30
- 3 Inactive Large Golems filled (6 Anima each)
- Boss pulled with 4 Anima at 1:30 mark
- Boss dies before ~3:36 mark (100 Anima)

### 25-Man
- Both Massive Golems at 36 Anima before 1:30
- 6 Anima Golems alive at 2:00 mark
- Proper consolidation at 2:12
- Boss dies before ~4:00 mark (100 Anima)

### Universal
- Zero Acceleration Links
- Zero Large Golem activations
- Clean Matter Swap dispels (no deaths)
- Zero casts caught by Interrupting Jolt
- Survive Empower Golem damage spikes
