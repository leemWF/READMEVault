# Durumu the Forgotten - Raid Leader Strategy Guide

## 📋 **Fight Overview**
Durumu is a **three-phase cyclical encounter** requiring precise execution. The fight alternates between Normal Phase, Colorblind Phase (revealing invisible adds with colored light cones), and Disintegration Beam Phase (following safe zones while boss spins deadly beam). **10-minute hard enrage.**

**Core Mechanic:** Normal Phase → Colorblind Phase (find/kill adds with light cones) → Normal Phase → Disintegration Beam (follow safe zone) → Repeat

## 🎯 **THE THREE PHASES**

### **Phase 1: Normal Phase** (Default State)
- Durumu stationary in center, must be in melee range
- Basic tank mechanics + raid damage
- Void zone positioning from Lingering Gaze

### **Phase 2: Colorblind Phase** (Every ~3 min, starts 0:30)
- 3 colored light cones appear (Red, Blue, Yellow)
- Red/Blue follow targeted players, Yellow moves on its own
- **Must reveal and kill 3 Crimson Fog adds** to end phase
- **Intense raid damage** - use cooldowns
- **Heroic:** 80-second hard timer or wipe

### **Phase 3: Disintegration Beam Phase** (Every ~3 min, starts 2:30)
- Room fills with deadly Eye Sores (1/12th every second)
- Durumu channels rotating death beam (1-minute duration)
- Safe zones form beside beam - **must follow them or die**
- Beam becomes lethal after 10 seconds

## ⚠️ **DEADLY MECHANISMS**

### **Normal Phase Abilities**

| Ability | Danger Level | Details |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Gaze** | 🔴🔴🔴 LETHAL | If no one in melee range, spam casts on raid = wipe |
| **Hard Stare** | 🔴 HIGH | Tank damage + Serious Wound (reduces healing) + Arterial Cut (bleed until topped) |
| **Force of Will** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Narrow cone knockback - telegraphed |
| **Lingering Gaze** | 🔴 HIGH | Creates permanent void zones (15y radius), slows movement - **stay out** |
| **Life Drain** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Hungry Eye drains random player 15s - increasing damage if stays on same target |

### **Colorblind Phase Mechanics** 🔴🔴🔴

**Light Cones:**
- **Red Cone:** Follows targeted player, reveals Crimson Fogs (3 total)
- **Blue Cone:** Follows targeted player, reveals Azure Fog (respawns when killed)
- **Yellow Cone:** Moves clockwise/counter-clockwise on its own

**Critical Rules:**
- Empty cone = massive raid damage (Infrared Light / Blue Rays / Bright Light)
- Players in cone = high damage split among them
- **Must kill all 3 Crimson Fogs to end phase**
- Moving cone away from revealed-but-alive add = massive raid damage + likely wipe

**Fog Adds:**
- **Crimson Fog:** Revealed by red cone, spams Caustic Spike (Physical damage)
- **Azure Fog:** Revealed by blue cone, casts Icy Grasp (increasing damage in cone) - **DON'T REVEAL**
- **Amber Fog (Heroic):** Revealed by yellow cone, casts Amber Retaliation (damage per 10% HP lost)

### **Disintegration Beam Phase Mechanics** 🔴🔴🔴

| Mechanic | Danger Level | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Eye Sores** | 🔴🔴 HIGH | Cover room progressively (1/12th per second), heavy damage |
| **Disintegration Beam** | 🔴🔴🔴 INSTANT DEATH | Becomes lethal after 10 seconds, rotates with safe zones |
| **Safe Zones** | ✅ SURVIVAL | Form beside beam (melee + ranged), must follow them as they move |

---

## 🔴 **HEROIC MODE CHANGES**

### **⚡ New Mechanics**

**1. Colorblind Phase 80-Second Timer** 🔴🔴🔴
- Hard timer added to Colorblind Phase
- If not finished in 80 seconds = instant wipe
- Must optimize Crimson Fog kills

**2. Amber Fog Add (Yellow Cone)**
- Third fog type revealed by yellow cone
- **Must kill immediately** (yellow cone moves on its own)
- Casts Amber Retaliation: Damage to yellow cone players when loses 10% HP
- Burst of Amber: Massive raid damage if unrevealed before death

**3. Walls of Ice**
- Appear before each Colorblind + Disintegration Beam phase (except first Colorblind)
- Divide platform into sectors
- Made of attackable segments with low HP
- **Block movement** - must AoE down quickly or wipe

**4. Dark Parasite + Wandering Eyes**
- Begins after first Disintegration Beam
- Dark Parasite: Dispellable DoT on random players (increases damage over time)
- When dispelled → becomes Dark Plague (spawns Wandering Eye every 3 seconds)
- **Wandering Eye:** Fixates random player, deals damage, **mirrors all damage taken to fixated target**
- **Must kill with light damage only** (cleave/light AoE)

## 📊 **READY-TO-USE ASSIGNMENTS**

### **Tank Assignments**

| Tank | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Tank 1** | Durumu Primary | • Tank Durumu in center<br>• Swap when Serious Wound stacks high<br>• Must be healed to 100% to remove Arterial Cut |
| **Tank 2** | Durumu Secondary | • Swap with Tank 1<br>• Same responsibilities |

**Tank Positioning:**
- Always someone in melee range (Gaze = raid wipe)
- Can single-tank with Paladin using Divine Shield to remove Hard Stare debuffs

**Colorblind Phase:**
- Tanks stand in Blue or Yellow cone
- Face Durumu away from Red cone (melee DPS)

### **Colorblind Phase Assignments**

**Cone Distribution:**

| Cone | Assigned Players | Reason |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Red** | ALL Melee DPS | Need to be in range to kill Crimson Fogs |
| **Yellow** | Ranged DPS | Can DPS from anywhere |
| **Blue** | Healers + Tanks | Stationary, focus on healing |

**Spotter Role:**
- 1 player marks fog locations before phase starts (brief flash shows positions)
- Calls out locations via voice/raid markers

**Red Cone Driver:**
- Player targeted by red cone
- Moves to each Crimson Fog location in sequence
- **Stays at each fog until it's dead**
- **Never leaves revealed fog before it dies**

**Blue Cone Driver:**
- Player targeted by blue cone
- Moves AWAY from Azure Fog location
- **NEVER reveals Azure Fog**

**Crimson Fog Kill Priority:**
1. First Crimson Fog (red cone moves here)
2. Second Crimson Fog (after first dies)
3. Third Crimson Fog (phase ends when dead)

### **Disintegration Beam Phase Assignments**

**Movement Leader:**
- Mark 1 experienced player
- Everyone follows them through safe zones
- Move with the beam as it rotates

**Safe Zone Positioning:**
- **Melee Safe Zone:** Close to Durumu
- **Ranged Safe Zone:** Further out from Durumu
- Follow zones as they move around room

**Critical Rules:**
- Stay off Eye Sores (heavy damage, not instant death)
- Never get hit by Disintegration Beam (instant death)
- Move with safe zones as they expand/rotate

### **Life Drain Soaking**

**Soaking Rotation:**
- 2-3 players assigned per Life Drain
- Rotate standing between Hungry Eye and target
- Prevents increasing damage on single target
- Each soaker takes moderate damage burst

### **Heroic: Wall of Ice Teams**

**AoE Specialists:**
- Elemental Shamans (Earthquake, Chain Lightning)
- Warlocks (Rain of Fire, Cataclysm)
- Mages (Flamestrike, Blizzard)
- Anyone with large-radius AoE

**Priority:**
- Break down ALL wall segments before next phase
- Use max AoE damage immediately
- Segments are far apart - need ranged AoE

### **Heroic: Dark Parasite Management**

**Dispel Timing:**
- Healers: Dispel when DoT damage becomes dangerous
- Balance between: Heal through DoT vs Number of Wandering Eyes
- Classes with immunities (Divine Shield, Cloak of Shadows) remove harmlessly

**Wandering Eye Protocol:**
- **DO NOT burst down** - mirrors damage to fixated target
- Kill with: Cleave damage, light AoE, incidental damage
- Let them die slowly from passive damage

---

## 🎯 **LINGERING GAZE VOID ZONE STRATEGY**

**Option 1: Stack Under Boss**
- All void zones placed directly under Durumu
- Creates single massive danger zone in center
- Removes void zones from movement space
- Requires precise placement (touching zone = instant death)

**Option 2: Edge Placement**
- Place void zones at outer edge of platform
- Stand on very edge so half of void zone is off platform
- Easier execution than Option 1
- Some space still used

**Critical Rules:**
- Keep void zones 10-15 yards from Durumu (melee safe zone area)
- **Never connect two void zones** (creates larger obstacle)
- Leave gaps between zones for movement

## ⚙️ **PHASE ROTATION TIMELINE**

| Time | Phase | Key Events |
|------|-------|------------|
| 0:00 | Normal Phase | Pull, position void zones, soak Life Drain |
| 0:30 | **Colorblind Phase 1** | Reveal/kill 3 Crimson Fogs, heavy healing |
| ~2:30 | **Disintegration Beam 1** | Follow safe zones 60 seconds |
| ~3:30 | Normal Phase | Continue mechanics |
| ~5:30 | **Heroic: Walls of Ice** | AoE down quickly |
| ~5:30 | **Colorblind Phase 2** | 80-second timer (H), includes Amber Fog (H) |
| ~8:00 | **Heroic: Walls of Ice** | AoE down quickly |
| ~8:00 | **Disintegration Beam 2** | Dark Parasite active (H), follow safe zones |
| ~9:00 | Normal Phase | Push for kill |
| 10:00 | **HARD ENRAGE** | Obliterate = wipe |

## 💡 **CRITICAL TIPS**

### **Normal Phase**
✅ **Always someone in melee** - Durumu spams Gaze if no melee targets
✅ **Void zone discipline** - Poor placement = Disintegration Beam wipe
✅ **Force of Will** - Move out of narrow cones (telegraphed)
✅ **Life Drain soaking** - Rotate 2-3 players to minimize healing to boss

### **Colorblind Phase**
✅ **Spot fog locations** - 1-2 second window before phase starts
✅ **Red cone priority** - Melee must be in red to kill Crimson Fogs
✅ **NEVER reveal Azure Fog** - Causes Icy Grasp (increasing blue cone damage)
✅ **NEVER move cone from revealed fog** - Massive raid damage
✅ **Kill Crimson Fogs fast** - Each second = more raid damage
✅ **Empty cone = raid damage** - Distribute players evenly
✅ **Heroic: 80 seconds or wipe** - Optimize kill speed
✅ **Heroic: Amber Fog = priority** - Yellow cone moves on its own

### **Disintegration Beam Phase**
✅ **Follow marked player** - Easiest way to survive
✅ **Eye Sores hurt but don't kill** - Focus on beam avoidance
✅ **Safe zones expand** - More room as phase progresses
✅ **Stay behind beam** - It rotates, safe zones move with it
✅ **10-second grace period** - Beam harmless initially

### **Heroic Specific**
✅ **Walls of Ice = top priority** - Block movement, must AoE down
✅ **Wandering Eyes = light damage** - Mirrors to fixated players
✅ **Dark Parasite timing** - Balance DoT damage vs Eye spawns
✅ **Immunities** - Divine Shield, Cloak remove Dark Parasite cleanly

## 🚨 **DEADLY SITUATIONS**

| Situation | Result | Prevention |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **No melee on Durumu** | Gaze spam = wipe | Always tank in melee |
| **Empty light cone** | Massive raid damage | Distribute players evenly |
| **Moving cone from revealed fog** | Burst of damage = deaths | Stay on fog until dead |
| **Revealing Azure Fog** | Icy Grasp = blue cone deaths | Blue cone avoids Azure location |
| **Hit by Disintegration Beam** | Instant death | Follow safe zones |
| **Colorblind over 80s (H)** | Instant wipe | Optimize DPS, kill fast |
| **Walls not broken (H)** | Movement blocked = wipe | Max AoE immediately |
| **Bursting Wandering Eyes (H)** | Mirrored damage = deaths | Light damage only |
