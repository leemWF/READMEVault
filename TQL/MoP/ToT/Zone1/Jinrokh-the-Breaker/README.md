## **Fight Overview**
Jin'rokh is a DPS race with simple mechanics but high execution requirements. The fight involves managing beneficial water zones that eventually turn deadly, handling lightning orbs, and coordinating tank swaps. After approximately 7 minutes, the entire room becomes covered in damaging void zones, creating a soft enrage.

## **Core Mechanics**

**Conductive Water & Lightning Storm Cycles:**
- Fight divided into 4 cycles, each ~90 seconds
- Each cycle starts with Thundering Throw creating a Conductive Water pool (1/4 of room)
- Standing in Conductive Water grants 40% increased damage and healing, but also 80% increased Nature damage taken
- After 90 seconds, Lightning Storm turns the water into Electrified Waters (deadly, no longer beneficial)
- Entire raid stacks center room during Lightning Storm with defensive cooldowns

**Focused Lightning (Every ~15 seconds):**
- Orb fixates on random ranged/healer, moves toward them
- Players must kite orbs OUT of Conductive Water to designated drop zones (near walls or future statue locations)
- Explosion creates Lightning Fissure (persistent ground damage)
- If orb touches a Fissure = Implosion (massive raid damage)
- If orb explodes in compromised water = raid wipe

**Static Burst & Tank Swaps:**
- Applies 10 stacks of Static Wound to current tank (Nature damage on melee hits + splash to raid)
- Requires immediate tank swap
- Tanks should taunt ~3 seconds before Thundering Throw to ensure correct tank gets thrown

**Thundering Throw (Every 90 seconds):**
- Throws current tank at a mogu statue, breaking it and creating Conductive Water
- Resets threat - off-tank must taunt immediately
- Deals splash damage to players within 14 yards of landing

## **🔴 HEROIC DIFFERENCES**

### **New Mechanic 1: Ionization**
- Cast on all non-tanks 1 minute after pull, then every 90 seconds thereafter
- Lasts 24 seconds, can be dispelled
- When removed or expired, deals very high Nature damage (~300k+) to the player and anyone within 8 yards
- **If dispelled in Conductive Water, hits ENTIRE raid in the water**

**Heroic Strategy:**
- Raid spreads 8+ yards apart before dispel
- Players must be OUT of water and topped off
- Dispel progressively over 24 seconds (not all at once)
- Immunities (Ice Block, Divine Shield, Cloak of Shadows) prevent application if active BEFORE cast
- Players with self-dispels + defensives should handle themselves

### **New Mechanic 2: Lightning Strike**
- Occurs during every Lightning Storm - lightning beams hit ground with 4 sparks traveling outward in each direction
- Contact = high Nature damage
- **Can no longer stack during Lightning Storm - everyone must dodge individually**

## **READY-TO-USE ASSIGNMENTS**

### **Tank Assignments**
- **Tank 1:** Pull boss, taunt 3 seconds before each Thundering Throw
- **Tank 2:** Taunt immediately after Static Burst, taunt boss immediately after Tank 1 is thrown
- **Both:** Position to control statue order if designated by RL
- **DK Tanks:** Use Anti-Magic Shell to prevent Static Wound application

### **Healer Assignments**
**Normal Mode:**
- Stack with raid in Conductive Water
- Position near water edge for quick exit if targeted by Focused Lightning
- Stack center during Lightning Storm, use healing CDs

**Heroic Mode:**
- Assign dispel rotation for Ionization (spread dispels over 24 seconds)
- Ensure all dispel targets are topped off and out of water
- Cannot stack during Lightning Storm - dodge individually while healing

### **DPS Assignments**
**Ranged/Healers:**
- Designated Focused Lightning drop zones: [Assign specific locations - e.g., "North and South walls" or "In front of unbroken statues"]
- If targeted, immediately kite OUT of water to drop zone
- Do NOT let orb touch Lightning Fissures

**Melee:**
- Stay in Conductive Water (boss hitbox is large enough)
- Continue DPS during all phases except Lightning Storm

**All DPS:**
- Save cooldowns for Conductive Water windows (never use at pull)
- Use Heroism/Bloodlust 20 seconds after first Conductive Water spawns

### **Heroic: Ionization Response Team**
- Players with immunities: Use BEFORE Ionization cast to avoid debuff entirely
- Players with self-dispel + defensives: Self-dispel when safe
- Everyone else: Wait for assigned healer dispel, stay spread, stay out of water

### **Cooldown Rotation**
- **Pull:** NO cooldowns
- **First Water (~20s in):** Heroism + all DPS cooldowns
- **Lightning Storm 1-4:** Raid defensive cooldowns (assign Spirit Link, Barrier, Rally, etc.)
- **Subsequent Waters:** Use 1-2 min CDs as available

### **DPS Requirements (Heroic)**
- 10H with 5 DPS: 126k each
- 10H with 6 DPS: 108k each  
- 25H with 16-18 DPS: 119-133k each

## **Pull Sequence**
1. Tanks position boss center, raid stacks
2. Handle Focused Lightning to designated zones
3. At 30s - Tank 1 gets thrown, Tank 2 taunts, raid moves into first water
4. At 50s - Pop Heroism + all DPS cooldowns
5. **Heroic:** At 1:00 - Ionization cast, raid spreads for dispels
6. At 1:30 - Lightning Storm, stack center (Normal) / dodge individually (Heroic)
7. At 2:00 - Second Thundering Throw, repeat cycle
8. **Goal:** Kill before 4th Lightning Storm when room is fully covered

---

## **Quick Reference**
- **Raid Comp:** 2 tanks, 2-3 healers (10m) / 5-7 healers (25m)
- **Soft Enrage:** ~7 minutes (room fully covered)
- **Key Timers:** Thundering Throw every 90s, Focused Lightning every 15s, Static Burst frequently
- **Heroic Additions:** Ionization at 1:00 + every 90s, Lightning Strike during all Lightning Storms
