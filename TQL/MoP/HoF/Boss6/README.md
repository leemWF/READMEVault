## Phase 1 (2.5min, boss)

- shield (spell casts dmg it)
	- ppl with shadow DoT go inside (with PW:S or personal up)
	- while inside, cannot be healed 
	- out when low for heal then back inside 
	- when shield dies, huge aoe physical dmg
		- most likely just heal
		- raid CDs can be used on melee
		- personal otherwise
- DoTs (only caster and healer)
	- shadow (for shield)
	- physical spread
- tank swap, 3 stacks for best veng

## Phase 2 (adds or 2.5min, back to 1)

- 6 windblades
	- fixate
	- dispatch (physical dmg, interrupt)
	- blate: high dmg on current target
	- ooze: 4 merges into a trap, can used to stun/dps adds, but baldes can free trapped

tanks
- bdk on 2 reavers on 1 side
- bears on 6 windblades on the other side (cd at start when 6 together)
	- kite/interrupt
	- kill 4 and slow on 2
	- trap 1, kill 1 and leave 1
	- trap 2, kill all

## Phase 3 (30%)
