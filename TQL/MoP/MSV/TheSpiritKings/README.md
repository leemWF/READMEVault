## The Spirit Kings <H/WIP>

> ✅ Heroic Notes:
> - Single tank still recommanded.
> - At ~30% HP of each boss, the next King activates, stacking phases.

### ⚔️ Abilities (per boss)

- Single tank
- Boss order is fixed: Qiang → Subetai → Zian → Meng. A lot of movements.

| Boss      | Unique Ability                                | Retained After Death                           |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Qiang/stack** | frontal cone attack split between all affected / AoE attack with 3-second visual effect before cast | warrior add marshing (2 in H), 1-shot mech     |
| **Subetai/spread** | 8-yard of a random raid member (stun+dmg, arrow kill req or blink) / 3-step frontal cone (smaller but more dmg) | charge a random player and debuff 8yard (less heal/dmg + more dmg taken)     |
| **Zian/spread**  | shadow blast interruptable (4-5s) / 8yard jumping dmg | Undying Shadows, add → fixates on nearest → dmg all in 10y → void shrinks and spawn add again → 2nd kill req (kite to edge)  |
| **Meng/spread loosely**  | aoe "MC" → stack and designed aoe  / crazy thought interruptable (5s, >60 not more interrupt)  | Insanity switch between dmg reflection and more tank dmg              |

Heroic Only: every 40s and not retained 
- Qiang: reflect bubble → MD or shatter throw
- Subetai: bubble debuff attacker (less dmg and armory) → stun boss (during stun no debuff)
- 💀💀💀Zian: 300k reflect bubble → magic dispel
- Meng: enrage (double insanity) → hunter/rogue/druid dispel
- Tips
  - stop a few secs before bubble
  - DoTs do not trigger bubble
