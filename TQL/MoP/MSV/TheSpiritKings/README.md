### 🧠 Strategy Overview

1. Boss order is fixed: Q → S → Z → M.
2. Each boss activates at ~30% of the previous.
3. Incorporeal bosses retain one mechanic.
4. Requires high movement coordination.
5. Beat the 10-minute enrage with consistent damage.

### 🛡 Tank Assignments

- **Main Tank** picks up active boss.
- Swap on **Undying Shadows** adds or high tank damage.
- Incorporeal bosses don't need tanking.

---

### 🩺 Healer Roles

- Rotate per phase:
  - **Qiang**: mild cleave → stacked healing.
  - **Subetai**: spread for Rain of Arrows → raid heals.
  - **Zian**: tank-heavy phase + add soaks → strong CDs.
  - **Meng**: fear/Insanity → cleanse and raid CDs.
- Use healing CDs proactively as phases overlap.

---

### 🎯 DPS Responsibilities

- Maintain high uptime for enrage.
- Handle Pillage turrets and Undying Shadows.
- Avoid waves/arrows/shouts; plan movement.
- Dispel and interrupt if applicable.

---

### ⚠️ Movement & Warnings

- **Flanking Orders**: dodge sideways.
- **Rain of Arrows**: spread to minimize overlap.
- **Undying Shadows**: tank soak and burst.
- **Maddening Shout**: interrupt/fear protection.

---

### 🧩 Role Assignments

- **Tank 1**: active boss, Zian cleave soak.
- **Tank 2**: Pillage adds, Zian assist.
- **Healer 1**: Qiang/Subetai.
- **Healer 2**: Zian focus.
- **Healer 3**: Meng + dispels.
- **Healer 4 (opt)**: support across phases.
- **DPS**: split group to handle movement zones, Pillage, and Undying Shadows.

---

### 🧃 Hero

- Use **at start of Zian** phase for max impact.
- Alternate: just before Meng for final burst.

---

### 🔧 Optional Tips

- Assign callouts for movement.
- Use visual markers.
- Pre-assign soakers for Zian.
- WeakAura to track Flanking/Arrows.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- Boss order: Qiang → Subetai → Zian → Meng.
