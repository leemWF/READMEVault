## The Stone Guard

### Abilities 
- Amethyst Guardian - Purple/Shadow
  - void zone
- Cobalt Guardian - Blue/Arcane
  - trap (explode and freeze)  
- Jade Guardian - Green/Nature
  - raid AoE
- Jasper Guardian - Red/Fire
  - chain (apart for 15sec to break, cumulative, not continuous)

### 🛡 Tanking
Generally whoever with debuff boss, always grab lower energy boss too (tank comm)

Alternative
- tank1: always 2, always keep 1 with debuff to you
- tank2: always 1, no debuff boss and taunt the one with highest energy
  - [H] and when stablized, help with tiles and can use tanking CD

### ⚠️ WARN
- move slow as debuff stacks
- deal with movement related mech asap
- trap: trying to break during blue (wrong tooltip) or anyone with CD (ideally can dispel), e.g mage/hunter/rogue etc (wait for dispel cd otherwise)
- chain trying to break during red or personal cd together

### 🧃 Hero
- [H] 30s = 80+ stacks of Energized Tiles, pick crystal with active debuff for dmg reduction
  - try 3 range
  - if not great try 2 (hunter for sure)
  - may use personal CD for crystals with no active debuff (50-60k per sec at start)
  - hero when done  
- [N] beginning for max output
- Energized Tiles are reset by the bosses when they reach 75% and 40% health.

### Optional
- 3 heal for prog
- start with 3 together for a while (cleave as much as possible) and use raid CDs and pump heal

## Feng the Accursed

> ✅ Heroic Notes:
> - You choose the order of the four spirits.
> - Adds an entirely new phase: Spirit of the Shield.
> - Requires active use of special tank abilities.
> - ➡️ Staff → Shield → Fist → Spear (move close to that side to trigger)
>   - Staff → Fist → Shield → Spear alternatively

### 💀 Abilites
- staff
  - velocity (raid aoe): stack at boss if possible
    - no pre-stack, spread early (under butt)
  - resonance: debuff aoe 6y (more ppl = more dmg), before/after velocity, prefer range(watch out monk heal)
    - personal cd required during velocity
- Shield
  - chain: more raid dmg and stack for better raid heal
  - throw shield: special or slow/push/grab and nuke
    - everyone away from shield (adds from random players)
    - special tank on shield
- Fist
  - front cone/stun, (has cast) and tank avoid
  - raid aoe with -75%hit (special/raidCD/get away)
    - try stack at boss first
    - if not, stack away (less base dmg) 
- Spear
  - wildfire: drop in assigned location and AVOID at all cost
  - drawfire: avoid in the path and use special to block (huge raid dmg)

### 🛡 Tanks
- Pre‑pull: Tank 1 → Barrier/right, Tank 2 → Reversal/left (dk copy).
- 2 stacks tank swap
- **Use Barrier (channeling)**:
  - Phase 1: Arcane Velocity(1st).
  - Phase 2: Adds absorb cast (cast on shield, 1st and 3nd).
  - Phase 3: Epicenter (1st and 3nd).
  - Phase 4: Draw Flame (🔥 Block stacks).
- **Use Reversal**:
  - Copy Lightning Fists → stun boss during Epicenter.

### 🩺 Healers
- Prepare raid CDs for if no Barrier:
  - Arcane Velocity.
  - Epicenter.
  - Draw Flame ticking damage.

### 🧃 Hero
- At start

## Gara’jal the Spiritbinder

> ✅ Heroic Notes:
> - Voodoo Dolls reflect 100% of damage.
>   - Enrage at 6 min. Check DPS.
> - Frail Soul debuff: everyone in, 3rd heal = help disc + mana refill then out.
> - Banished tank must kill 3 adds (1 personal red add).
> - Totem selection/rotation is critical. 

### 💀 Abilities

- Voodoo Dolls: shared damage, current tank (fixate) + 2 players
  - Banishment: tank with Dolls gets banished after 60s.
- Shadowy Attacks: frequent physical/shadow damage on current tank (ignore absorb!)
  - due to comp, 3 heal may be needed, tank: max mitigation + watch linked members + rotate CDs (personal + call raid CD)
- Spirit Totem: spawns every ~20s → kill to allow 3 closest to enter Spirit World.
  - banished tank has personal red add
  - heal gives Spiritual Innervation buff (resource regen); heal to full enable exit

TODO
----
Final Phase (20%): No more Spirit Realms. Raid-wide ticking damage. Bloodlust.
> - No more totems after 20% → final burn phase.
