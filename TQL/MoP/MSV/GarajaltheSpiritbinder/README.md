## Garaâ€™jal the Spiritbinder

> âœ… Heroic Notes:
> - Voodoo Dolls reflect 100% of damage.
>   - Enrage at 6 min. Check DPS.
> - Frail Soul debuff: everyone in required, 3rd heal = help disc + mana refill then out.
> - Banished tank must kill 3 adds (1 personal red add).

### ðŸ’€ Abilities

- Voodoo Dolls: shared damage, current tank (fixate) + 2 players
  - Banishment: tank with Dolls gets banished after 60s.
- Shadowy Attacks: frequent physical/shadow damage on current tank (ignore absorb!)
  - due to comp, 3 heal may be needed, tank: max mitigation + watch linked members + rotate CDs (personal + call raid CD, esp enraged)
- Spirit Totem: spawns every ~20s â†’ kill to allow 3 closest (melee range) to enter Spirit World.
  - start with 30% hp (need big heal) 
  - banished tank has personal red add
  - heal gives Spiritual Innervation buff (resource regen); heal to full = enable exit (exit before 30s)

### ðŸ›¡ Tanks

- 2-tank swap:
  - tank1 gets Voodoo Dolls and will be fixated/banished after ~60s.
  - tank2 try keeping 2nd aggro (early taunt wont cancel fixate but can copy threat), otherwise taunts immediately after banishmen.
- when banished: Kill red (only you can target it).

### ðŸ©º Healers

- 2-heal: 1 healer enters Spirit World with each totem wave (disc â†’ mist)
- 3-heal: disc â†’ (mist + rest) ...
  - mist needs helping with aoe
  - rest exits asap (when mana ok) and help disc
  - or mist always up if no mana issue  
- Prioritize raid/big healing to gain Spiritual Innervation/enable exit
- watch out
  - Shadowy Attacks (both tank and Voodoo-linked players)
  - rotate CD last 20% (cookie/rally/banner/smoke/revive/PWB + totem/link)

### ðŸŽ¯ DPS

- totem rotation (no fixed in H)
  - 2-heal, hunter prio disc, 3-heal, hunter prio mist (or big aoe class)
  - voodoo or debuff (away from totem) cannot enter
  - 1min CD when entering, interrupt and kill
- PUMP!

### ðŸ§ƒ Hero

Final Phase (20%): No more Spirit Realms. Raid-wide ticking damage. Bloodlust and stack
