### ⚔️ Fight Overview

This is a **dual-boss + add-heavy** fight, split into two overlapping phases:

#### ▶️ Phase 1: Add Waves (Start → ~90s)
- Waves every 15s:
- **Emperor’s Rage** (fixate on random raid member).
- **Emperor’s Courage** (tanks).
- **Emperor's Strength** (front cleave).
- **Titan Gas** is always active—extra pressure on healers [oai_citation:4‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/will-of-the-emperor-strategy-guide-normal-heroic?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

#### ▶️ Phase 2: Qin-xi & Jan-xi (After ~90s → Death)
- Both bosses share a health pool.
- Continue spawning Phase‑1 adds until kill final bosses.
- **Devastating Combo**: occasional long boss cleave.
- Bosses exit add waves when low on HP (soft enrage/phase end).

---

### 🛡 Tank Assignments

- **Tank 1**: Primary tank on bosses.
- **Tank 2**:
- Picks up **Courage adds**.
- Handles **Strength adds** (tank soak).
- Swaps for Devastating Combo if needed.

➡️ Tanks must **soak Courage and Strength adds**, avoiding overstacking them, and swap as needed between Rage waves.

---

### 🩺 Healer Strategy

- **All Healers**:
- Use cooldowns continuously—Titan Gas never stops.
- **Add Wave Healer**:
- Focus on spiky damage during **Courage/Strength** waves.
- **Boss Phase Healer**:
- Cleanse Courage stacks and heal through Devastating Combo.
- Prep for heal-intensive add waves + constant gas.

---

### 🎯 DPS Responsibilities

- **Consistent DPS** on bosses—time add-heavy opening properly.
- **Crowd Control Emperor’s Rage**:
- Cull waves quickly—spawn fewer Titan Sparks [oai_citation:5‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/will-of-the-emperor-strategy-guide-normal-heroic?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:6‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/751-will-of-the-emperor/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:7‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/feng-the-accursed-strategy-guide-normal-heroic?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Detonate grouped sparks with one AoE burst.
- Transition to boss DPS when safe, then back to adds as needed.

---

### ⚠️ Warnings & Tips

- **Titan Gas**: affects melee – healers must prep.
- **Devastating Combos** require tank swaps + raid CDs.
- **Titan Sparks** from adds kill drive DPS loss—control, cc, detonate.
- **Emperor’s Rage** fixate is interruptable or kitable.
- Keep **adds stacked** for healing uptime—avoid scattering.

---

### 🧩 Role Assignments

- **Tank 1**: Primary boss tank, soak Strength adds when 2 tanks swap.
- **Tank 2**: Handles Courage adds and front cleaves.
- **Healer 1**: Raid CDs during Devastating Combos.
- **Healer 2**: Focus Courage soak waves & Titan Gas.
- **Healer 3**: Add wave main heals and spike mitigation.
- **Healer 4+ (opt)**: Assist constantly with raid healing and gas.
- **DPS 1–3**: Crowd control + group Rage adds.
- **DPS 4–6**: AoE burst to detonate Titan Sparks + DPS bosses.

---

### 🧃 Hero (Bloodlust/Heroism)

- **Pop early—after initial add wave**, ideally before first Devastating Combo.
- Maintains DPS on bosses & Sparks → shortens exposure to Titan Gas.

---

### 🔧 Optional Tips

- Assign specific **add detectors** for waves.
- Use AoE crowd-control boxes/spells.
- Pre-plan **tampered DPS windows** during Rage Spark waves.
- WeakAuras for tracking **add spawn timers** & Titan Gas timer.
- Consider kill order: **Courage → Rage → Strength** to reduce spikes [oai_citation:8‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/751-will-of-the-emperor/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### ✅ TL;DR

- Handle overlapping **constant Titan Gas**.
- Coordinate **add waves + bosses** effectively.
- Use crowd control to minimize **Titan Sparks**.
- Maintain raid-wide cds for Devastating Combos + gas.
- Pop Heroism early for maximum uptime and mitigation.
