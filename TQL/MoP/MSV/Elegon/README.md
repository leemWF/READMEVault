⚠️⚠️⚠️Like Rag, boss is stationary!

#### 📍 Stage 1 – Center Platform (85% and 50%, stage ends)

- **Celestial Breath**: front cone
- **Celestial Protectors** spawn: every 35 seconds and tank required
  - high arcane dmg to random (with -50% heal debuff, dispellable)
  - if >25%HP and in outer ring, 90% dmg reduction/if <25%HP, aoe raid
  - when killed, huge aoe (will be buffed if innner ring)
    - in normal, 200k everyone
    - in H, 500k to only ppl in outer ring, stun/dot (heal to 80% to dispel) and cannot take aoe for 2min (1 in 10 so tank with CD)
- 🛡 Tank: alter between boss and add to drop stacks
- 🎯 DPS: melee NEEDs to reset stack too (can ignore 1st add for boss DPS)

#### 🔋 Stage 2 – Draw Power (when one or more Energy Charges reach their destination)

- Kill orbs, e.g.
  - 1/2/3: caster + dk + disc
  - 4/5/6: melee + hunter + bear + mist
  - adjust as needed 
- Time between waves shrinks; kill 4(min)–6(ideal) waves. Skip the last wave and burst Elegon. (10% per wave)
  - inner ring for Max DPS but reset stack still NEEDED
  - each add die causes aoe (33250 x 6) and plan personal CSs


#### 🌌 Stage 3 – Outer Ring (Triggered by first Charge reaching pillar)

⚠️⚠️⚠️20s inner ring disappear. DONT be greedy! RUN!

- DONT cross before pillar killed!
- 🛡 Tank: grab adds (spark)
- 🎯 DPS: pillar → adds
  - for 2nd, drag all adds into inner and cleave with boss
- ALL: DODGE lightning zone
- dmg grows as pillars down and group at entrance

#### 🔥 Burn Phase

- constant AoE, outer ring higher (try all time inner and MAX DPS)
- STACK and PUMP!
  - 1 tank takes veng from boss
  - 1 tank takes veng from adds
  - tank MAX veng (swap to keep veng and rotate CDs)
- rotate raid CDs (cookie/rally/banner/smoke/revive/PWB)

### 🧃 Hero (Heroism/Bloodlust)

- Burn phase
- Alternatively, 2nd stage 2 for more dmg stacks (6+) and early boss burn
