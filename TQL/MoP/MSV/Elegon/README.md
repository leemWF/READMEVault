> - **Overcharged** stacks build in the center, dealt by stepping off the platform [oai_citation:1‡Wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elegon?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
> - **Celestial Protectors** spawn early: tanks must drag them off-center before **Total Annihilation** at ~20% HP [oai_citation:2‡Wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elegon?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
> - **Phase 3** begins when a Charge reaches a pillar: floor disappears, splits arena into 6 sectors [oai_citation:3‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/elegon-strategy-guide-normal-heroic?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:4‡Wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elegon?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

⚠️⚠️⚠️Like Rag, boss is stationary!

#### 📍 Stage 1 – Center Platform (85% and 50%, stage ends)

<img width="875" height="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa57ac1e-de29-49b0-8b2b-6206d5c57f61" />

  - if >25%HP and in outer ring, 90% dmg reduction/if <25%HP, aoe raid
  - when killed, huge aoe(bug???, radius seems wrong, only tank) (will be buffed if innner ring)
- 🛡 Tank: alter between boss and add to drop stacks
- 🎯 DPS: melee NEEDs to reset stack too (can ignore 1st add for boss DPS)

#### 🔋 Stage 2 – Draw Power (when one or more Energy Charges reach their destination)

<img width="738" height="485" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd0549b5-707f-469c-8cc5-080a396db016" />

- Kill orbs, e.g.
  - 1/2/3: caster + dk + disc
  - 4/5/6: melee + hunter + bear + mist
  - adjust as needed 
- Time between waves shrinks; kill 4(min)–6(ideal) waves. Skip the last wave and burst Elegon. (10% per wave)
  - inner ring for Max DPS but reset stack still NEEDED
  - each add die causes aoe (33250 x 6) and plan personal CSs


#### 🌌 Stage 3 – Outer Ring (Triggered by first Charge reaching pillar)

⚠️⚠️⚠️20s inner ring disappear. DONT be greedy! RUN!

- DONT cross before pillar killed!
- 🛡 Tank: grab adds (spark)
- 🎯 DPS: pillar → adds
  - for 2nd, drag all adds into inner and cleave with boss
- ALL: DODGE lightning zone 

#### 🔥 Burn Phase

### 🛡 Tank Strategy

- **Tank 1**:
- Stage 1: pick up Celestial Protectors & drag them off-center.
- Stage 2: assist DPS with Energy Charges or continue boss.
- Stage 3: kite adds inside segmented zones.

- **Tank 2**:
- Focus on Protector control in Stage 1.
- Help handle adds in Stage 3 kiting group’s Sparks.

---

### 🩺 Healer Strategy

- **Stage 1**: Raid heals + tank cooldowns for Protector + TA.
- **Between waves**: Move off-center to clear **Overcharged** stacks.
- **Stage 2**: Healers help kill Charges, clear stacks.
- **Stage 3**: One heals each group’s DPS & tank; others handle adds/pillars.

---

### 🎯 DPS Assignments

- **Stage 1**: Split ranged/melee on boss & adds; clear stacks regularly.
- **Stage 2**: Assign 6 DPS groups to pillar positions (use raid markers).
- Kill waves plenty → skip last wave → max burst Elegon.
- **Stage 3**: Raid splits for pillars; DPS breaks Focuses, kills Sparks.

---

### ⚠️ Warnings & Tips

- Prioritize stack reset each 5 s to avoid lethal **Overcharged** buildup.
- Melee: step off quickly after Charge death to reset stacks [oai_citation:12‡Wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elegon?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:13‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/996-10n-elegon-adds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:14‡Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/elegon-strategy-guide-normal-heroic?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Skip last Charge wave if unable to clear all—shift to Elegon DPS.
- In Stage 3, don’t cross conduits; use assigned zones to avoid wall damage.

---

### 🧃 Hero (Heroism/Bloodlust)

- Use after **3–4 waves** in Stage 2, before final Charge → max burst uptime before transition.
- Alternatively, pop just before entering Stage 3 to assist pillar clears and add management.

---

### 🔧 Optional Tips

- Mark pillars 1–6 with raid markers in order.
- DPS should warn when last Charge reach pillar to signal split.
- Use weak auras to track Draw Power channel / Charge spawn.
- Assign one raid leader per side in Stage 3 to coordinate kiting & pillar calls.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- **Stage 1**: platform buffs (+ Touch/Overcharged), handle Protectors.
- **Stage 2**: focus waves, clear Charges → get stacks on Elegon.
- **Stage 3**: center collapses → arena splits; kill Focuses, manage adds.
- Strong movement, cleansing Overcharged, and coordinated DPS are key to success.
