### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN

- chain trying to break during red or personal cd together

### üßÉ Hero
- [H] 30s = 80+ stacks of Energized Tiles, pick crystal with active debuff for dmg reduction
  - try 3 range
  - if not great try 2 (hunter for sure)
  - may use personal CD for crystals with no active debuff (50-60k per sec at start)
  - hero when done  
- [N] beginning for max output
- Energized Tiles are reset by the bosses when they reach 75% and 40% health.

### Optional
- 3 heal for prog
- start with 3 together for a while (cleave as much as possible) and use raid CDs and pump heal
