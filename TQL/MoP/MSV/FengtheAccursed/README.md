### 💀 Abilites
- staff
  - velocity (raid aoe): stack at boss if possible
    - no pre-stack, spread early (under butt)
  - resonance: debuff aoe 6y (more ppl = more dmg), before/after velocity, prefer range(watch out monk heal)
    - personal cd required during velocity
- Shield
  - chain: more raid dmg and stack for better raid heal
  - throw shield: special or slow/push/grab and nuke
    - everyone away from shield (adds from random players)
    - special tank on shield
- Fist
  - front cone/stun, (has cast) and tank avoid
  - raid aoe with -75%hit (special/raidCD/get away)
    - try stack at boss first
    - if not, stack away (less base dmg) 
- Spear
  - wildfire: drop in assigned location and AVOID at all cost
  - drawfire: avoid in the path and use special to block (huge raid dmg)

### 🛡 Tanks
- Pre‑pull: Tank 1 → Barrier/right, Tank 2 → Reversal/left (dk copy).
- 2 stacks tank swap
- **Use Barrier (channeling)**:
  - Phase 1: Arcane Velocity(1st).
  - Phase 2: Adds absorb cast (cast on shield, 1st and 3nd).
  - Phase 3: Epicenter (1st and 3nd).
  - Phase 4: Draw Flame (🔥 Block stacks).
- **Use Reversal**:
  - Copy Lightning Fists → stun boss during Epicenter.

### 🩺 Healers
- Prepare raid CDs for if no Barrier:
  - Arcane Velocity.
  - Epicenter.
  - Draw Flame ticking damage.

### 🧃 Hero
- At start
