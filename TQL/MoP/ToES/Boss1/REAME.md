## Heroic

Remember my assigned position!!!

New add
- every 15s to lowest HP boss
- can be slowed 
- nearest 2 players get debuff when killed (2min)
- 10 stacks of debuff wipe the raid 
- (should not happen) if not killed, buff boss (3min) and 5 stacks wipe the raid

possible optimal rotation 
- Have Group 1 take 3 stacks of the debuff, by making sure that they are the closest ones to the dying Minions of Fear.
- Have Group 2 take 3 stacks of the debuff.
- Have Group 3 take 2 stacks of the debuff.
- Have Group 4 take 2 stacks of the debuff.
- Have Group 1 take another 2 stacks.
- Have Group 2 take another 2 stacks.
- Have Group 3 take another 3 stacks.
- Have Group 4 take another 3 stacks.
- From this point on, simply have Groups 1-4 take another 2 stacks each, until each player in these groups has 9 stacks. Then, have group 5 take 9 stacks, and by this point, your raid should have killed the bosses, or, if not, you can re-start the rotation.
